Here's what's new in the APRSISCE6P110123.zip and APRSIS32110123.zip

About version is 2011/01/23 18:55

Major Features:

AltNets (aprs101.pdf chapter 4) are supported.

"Auto-Reply" is now supported for responding from an unattended station

Support beaconing compressed locations as well as ambiguous positions

EchoLink nodes can now be queried, filtered, and displayed as objects

Dead Reckonging shows stations moving based on their last position, heading, and speed

WinMo Only: Track and Display Cellular coverage changes

Support fledgling AVRS server contacts directly from station popup menu (See http://aprs.org/avrs.html)

Support NWS Alert (http://www.aprs-is.net/wx/) reception and MultiLine Object (http://www.aprs-is.net/WX/MultilineProtocol.aspx) drawing.  Click the "Counties" or "Zones" links to find your 3 character NWS office ID.

Weather information is parsed and displayed (summary in labels, details in popup)

Now support Weather Object / Station beaconing with WxNow.txt-format data file input





Functionality Additions and Improvements:

Parse and display Storm (Hurricane) data including as labels if Screen / Labels / Weather is checked.

Display weather or storm summary on station popup menu instead of comment

New View filter based on the detected Platform of the clients.  Shows count and percentages as well, by platform.



Messaging Improvements:

Allow the case of callsigns in an active Chat to change.  This allows you to correct kj4erj-1 to KJ4ERJ-1 via Messages / Send Message without restarting APRSIS32.  Note that ? queries are CaSe SeNsItIvE on the answering side!

Duplicate messages (especially non-ack'd ones) are only counted in (*N hh:mm:ss) if they are on the same date.

(Hopefully) fixed the colorization and duplication of digi-heard outbound messages in the Chat window.

(Hopefully) fixed "Monitor" bringing up the wrong Chat if a message directed to you arrives while you're thinking about Monitoring or not.

Left (normal) button click on Chat URL opens browser.   Right click now simply copies URL to clipboard so you can paste it elsewhere.

New Messages / Chats menu that shows and provides access to active chats

If you Clear and Close a Chat window, it will go completely away, otherwise it simply hides

Configure / Messages / RF Eavesdrop supports eavesdropping on just RF-received (not -IS) messages.  This lets you display only "locally" heard messages rather than All.  Clear Eavesdrops clears these as well.

Messages / Auto-Reply has Message (what to send) and "Inactive For" and "No More Than" sub-menus.  "InActive For" is a delay since the last interaction with APRSISCE/32 before a configured Auto-Reply will be sent.  "No More Than" sets the minimum interval between Auto-Replies to a single station.

Fixed Auto-Reply and now show an inactivity countdown bar at the bottom of the messages pane if you have an Auto-Reply message configured.  It counts up to the "Inactive For" timer.

Auto-Answers are now delivered on a timer so that even if you ignore an incoming message, an AA: will be sent when the inactivity timer is exceeded, provided that the "No More Than" is not violated.  Otherwise it waits that interval since the last AA for that station.

Fixed timer AA: delivery to flush all future pending AA: for a station when one is sent.  Otherwise, it would send one per unread message at "No More Than" intervals!

If you change your callsign or -SSID, any existing chat window will disable itself from being able to send.  (Steve G6UIM)

New Messages / Announcements / Describe Groups sends "D" to get a list of groups with descriptions (NOT recommended on RF!)

Message groups in responses to queries are now sorted in alpha order by name



User Interface / Data Visibility Improvements:

Increased MaxTrackers from 10 to 16.  Range MultiTracks are still limited to 6 due to APRS-IS filter limitations.

Add last beacon timestamp to ME station info popup.  ME popup menu now shows beacon time, not Up: time (which is still shown in ME station info popup).

Corrected width of last packet display pane when a station popup menu is active.  (Was sizing with a proportional font and displaying fixed).

Configure / Messages / Lookup (WHO-IS) now has Brief (default for 1 line) and Full (3 lines of address) options.  Brief is highly recommended for non -IS users.

Locally configured bulletin text is now included in the Messages / Bulletin popup menu.

Announcement group subscriptions now support CQSRVR, but not quietly.  Messages / Announcements shows CQSRVR and Quiet status directly in the menu.

Message / Announcements / Active & My Groups now queries both CQSRVR and ANSRVR so expect 2 answers.

New Beacon / Symbol that remembers recently selected symbols to make it easy to switch between, say, Jogger, Bicyle, Van, and Phone.  Clear / Symbols will clear all remembered symbols (except the current one).

New Configure / Beacon / AltNet with remembered choices per aprs101.pdf Chapter 4.  Alternate Network IDs can be up 6 alphanumerics but not one of the generic APRS destination addresses from page 13 (23 in the PDF).  When an AltNet is selected, it will be shown in place of N(orth) on the map and only other stations in the same alternate network will be displayed if they match any checked View options.  (Steve AB3LT)

When an AltNet is in force, APRSISCE/32 will provide an automatic u/<AltNet> filter to ensure that all of the network's packets are received from APRS-IS.  This filter element is removed when the AltNet is set back to None.

"Used" AltNets are now flagged with a * and sorted to the top of the list.  An AltNet is marked Used if you ever had it checked.  Unused AltNets that have no recently heard stations are suppressed from the list.  Otherwise, the number in () is the count of stations recently heard using that AltNet.  There's lots of these as it seems that many UI-View users have messed up paths having removed the required "APRS," leading component (see the WIDE, WIDEn, and RELAY AltNets).

Support Configure / Beacon / Compressed for Base-91 (not Mic-E) compressed beacons from Chapter 9 of aprs101.pdf. If your symbol overlay is numeric, or both Course/Speed and Altitude are enabled, the Compressed setting will be ignored as it can't handle these conditions.  (Randy WF5X)

Improve Compressed beacon parser to retain all available precision.  Display such stations with 2 extra digits of accuracy.  (Should be less CPU intensive as well).

Fixed larger ambiguity display to be the proper size.  It was twice as large as it should have been.  (Hessu, aprs.fi)

Support 4 levels of position ambiguity per spec via Configure / Beacon / Precision (Eventually ambiguity will be supported on objects as well)

Add Screen / Labels / Ambiguity to show ambiguous circles and have View / Ambiguous toggle like other View options (James VE6SRV)

Windows Mobile version now shows tight squares around stations if Screen / Label / Ambiguous is turned on and not too many stations are visible.  Squares are cheaper to draw than circles which is why WinMo previously didn't show ambiguity on any but the centered station.  Both ambiguous circles are drawn if the centered station is ambiguous.

Change the RF-Received * to @ in the scrolling station log if the packet was actually digipeated by the local station.

Whenever the Configure / General / Add Filter is changed, send the new filter as an APRS message to "SERVER" and show the chat with the server's response.  This will help diagnose manually entered bogus filters that can cause the automatic ones to be ignored as well.  (Look for SERVER at http://www.aprs-is.net/javAPRSFilter.aspx)

Support View / EchoLinks... loading the current status directly from http://www.echolink.org/node_location.xml and generating local object as if they came from APRS-IS.

Note: View / EchoLinks only shows objects within a Range-based filter.  MultiTrack window centers and/or stations will not pick up EchoLinks unless you check the Range option on the MultiTracked stations's popup menu.

View / RF / 3rd Party shows stations whose packets have been received wrapped in a 3rd party packet

There are new View / Transport filters complete with counts of stations in that category:
RF Only will show stations that appear to be only using RF based on a path inspection (nothing about TCPIP or TCPXX in there).
RF + IS shows stations that appear to support both RF and -IS connectivity
RF IGate shows any station that has appeared after a q-construct indicating that it is an IGate
-IS Only shows stations that have always had TCPIP or TCPXX in their path
These options are the underlayment for some more intelligent features upcoming in the Messaging section.

MultiTrack windows now show - RANGING at the bottom center if you have selected the Range option for that window.  Note that the Range only applies to the Centered(Tracked) station, even if you pan the map around!  Unlike the main window which ADD filters for the tracked station's range to the map center's range.

Right-click in empty map space popup menu now incudes direct access to Chat and Monitor windows (Win32 only as WinMo has no right click).

Screen / Dead Reckoning - Better than a LRL (little red line)?:  New green-to-red (based on age) line extends from a station transmitting course and speed to the projected location based on that information and the elapsed time (up to 5 minutes since last beacon).  The station symbol is shown at the end of the line.  A centered and locked station will not move the map until an actual beacon has been received (centering doesn't chase the DR symbol).  Currently the DR icon is not clickable, but that will eventually be fixed.

Enables / Internet Access - If Unchecked, disables APRS-IS, all CWOP ports, OSM Tile fetching, Version checking.  If checked, allows those functions to follow their own enables.  This enables OSM and Version checking while still keeping APRS-IS disconnected if you want to go RF only.  (Julian G4ILO)

Screen / Label / Speed / All - If not checked, Beacon, Calculated, OR Average speed (and Dead Reckoning) are displayed, whichever is first available.  If All is checked, all available speeds are labeled and dead reckoned (yes, up to three forecasted stations will appear).

All station's with labels now show their configured Screen / Label / Speed selections.  It used to only display the currently followed station.

Added Configure / Map / Purger toggle to allow on-line enable/disable of the OSM tile purger!  No more editing the XML file to zero <OSM.RetainDays>!

WinMo Only:
Configure / Beacon / Cellular - Adds cellular carrier and signal strength to Beacon Comment
Configure / Status Report / Cellular - Adds cellular carrier and signal strenth to Status Report, forces Status Report on Carrier change
Screen / Labels / Cellular - Adds carrier and signal strength to station labels and also shows carrier changes and signal strengths on a new cellular track with points where either changes.  (Not tied to actual beacons!)

Station information popup now counts Digi, Igate, and RFDigi packets per hour.

Added time parsed from the packet (if any) to the Station Info popup labeled "Time:" (how appropriate).  It appears just above the local time that the most recent packet was received from that station.  For NWS objects, this is actually the Expiration time even though for all other packet types, it's the timestamp of the data contained in the packet.

New AVRS option on Station Popup menu to a) if ME, query nearby EchoLink/IRLP nodes or b) Initiate a Linked voice QSO (with confirmation).  See http://aprs.org/avrs.html.

New Configure / NWS menu with New Office, Messages, Notify, and Popup MultiTrack options.  NWS offices are 3 alpha characters or * for ALL!  Checking Messages will cause NWS-smelling messages to be captured and light up the Green Message pane.  Notify will cause such messages to notify you.  Popup MultiTrack will cause NWS objects (multi-line or not) to pop up an automatic MultiTrack window with View / None automatically selected to highlight why the window is there.

The automatic filter construction will include t/n if * is configured as an NWS station.  Otherwise, a b/XXX* buddy filter is included for every configured NWS station ID in order to get the packets from that station (http://www.aprs-is.net/wx/).

http://tinyurl.com/NWS-Offices - For US NWS office 3 character codes
http://www.crh.noaa.gov/arx/Stormready/WFOlist.php

For NWS objects, show the Issued: and Expire: time parsed from the object on the Station Popup dialog.

New option to save and restore "Always" MultiTracks.  Anytime MultiTracks are open when the client closes, you have an option to promote them to "Always".  If an Always MultiTrack is closed before the next shutdown, it will be removed from the "Always" list.

If Windows reports the battery life as unknown more than 60 times in a row, the battery bar (outside right) will be removed from the screen permanently.  This SHOULD only be on machines that currently permanently display 50%.  (Chris N3HEV)

Support Configure / Screen / Battery to re-enable an inadvertantly disabled battery display or turn it off even if a battery is present.

Support Configure / Screen / Date/Time / GPS Only to only show time if GPS is enabled.  It will still say "N/A" if time is not available.



GeoCaching Support:

Single geocache in a popup menu no longer displays a random packet below the map, but the cache's short description instead.

Geocaches in a popup menu now include container and difficulty/terrain

Geocaches now retain the long description on Windows Mobile (previously it was only the short description).

The geocache info popup now offers a "Hint" button if a hint is available.  These are not always helpful though!

View / Geocaches now supports geocaching.com's free (non-Premium) .LOC files.  There's not as much information in these, but it will show the ID, Coordinates, name, Terrain/Difficulty and container type.

New Configure / Screen / Label / GeoCache options to show any or all of ID, Type, Container, Difficulty/Terrain for loaded (and viewed) GeoCaches.  Geocache labels are only displayed if fewer than View.VisibleLabelsMax total caches are visible.



Object Support:

Object configuration now supports Items and various Object timestamps (DHM(h), HMS(z), and Permanent (111111z))

Suppress Objects from ?APRSD responses (?APRSL and ?APRSH already suppressed objects)

Support ?APRSO to transmit configured and enabled (but possibly 0 interval) objects on demand.

Enabled, but 0 interval objects are not transmitted on a timer, but are transmitted in response to a ?APRSO query

New Configure / Objects / New Weather - Prompts for a file name and location and otherwise works like a new object.  If the weather file cannot be accessed during a poll, the object automatically disables itself with a message in the Trace Log which is also brought to the front.



RF Port Support:

The RF Port Configuration Dialog's Beacon, Telemetry, and IS to RF checkboxes are now (theoretically) supported!  Type-specific paths are not yet done, and Me not 3rd is always enabled, but the remainder of the checkboxes should work now.  Now to get some of these into the -IS port to better support RF-only (satellite) operations.

Configure / Ports / APRS-IS now allows individual enable/disable of both directions of IGating (regardless of the RF port settings), Xmitting at all to the APRS-IS, and selection of the various packet types that may be generated by APRSISCE/32.  For those attempting to work RF-Only, you can now disable Bulletins, Beacons, Messages, and Telemetry from the APRS-IS while still keeping the RF to IS IGating active.

Configure / Ports / <YourRFPort> now supports individual enable/disable of Bulletins/Objects and/or Messages.

Disabled digipeating for Kenwood-specific port protocols as they don't transmit Used (*) path components.  The Digi and the RFPort trace logs will reflect this disabling action.



ANSRVR Support:

ANSRVR no longer sends back a "Still Monitoring" reply on a quiet KeepAlive request

ANSRVR now supports descriptions of groups which are settable via "D group description" but only by the owner which is the base callsign that first created the group.  (Julian G4ILO)

If you are the first member of a new group, you become the owner and your CQ Text becomes the group's description.

If you "? group" to ANSRVR, it will show the description, owner, and members (if less than 16) of the group.  Owners always receive the full membership list.

Both Active groups (?) and My Groups (L) will remind you of which groups you are owner.

ANSRVR now supports "D" to get one line per active group including the current description (and owner).  "D GROUP" will give the description of a single group along with membership.  "? GROUP" no longer gives members.



XML-Based Configuration parameters:

A new configuration parameter <View.VisibleLabelsMax> governs the maximum number of visible stations before labelling is suppressed.  It defaults to the original hard-coded parameters of 10 on WinMo and 50 on Win32.  Only changable (currently) via XML edit.

Telemetry transmissions are now limited by a new XML-editable parameter (<Telemetry.MinTime>, default 15 seconds).  Even if changes occur more frequently, telemetry will only be sent this frequently.

Configure / NWS / Offices are now checkable via the menus (defaults to checked for enabled).  You still have to edit the XML to get rid of the Office completely.



Bug Fixes:

Fixed a bug when the OSMTiles device ran low on free space.  APRSISCE would simply exit without warning instead of logging the issue and suspending the tile fetcher.

Patch around <Open/CloseCmd>s crashing APRSIS32 when attached to a TCP port.  A future revision will actually USE these elements on TCP ports!  (At least it doesn't crash on transmit for the D710s running over TCP-connected serial ports).

Fix a few random crashes when non-ASCII data is received and parsed.

Fix Screen / Follow / Find on APRSISCE when multiple or no matches are found.  It was hanging the client before.

Fix Screen / Follow / Find / MultiTrack to not bring the new station into the main window sometimes.

Hopefully fixed erroneous double-digi of packets in a WIDE2 configuration

Correctly attempt to parse weather from alternate and overlay (Numbered) weather stations (symbol _) per Bob.

Fixed a busted digipeat logic that was suppressing digis if packets were heard on -IS before RF.  It now digis any given packet once per 30 second period. (Steve G6UIM)

Cleaned up invalid AltNet recognition.  I now only remember AltNets from otherwise valid packets.  Corrupted Mic-E packets were causing lots of bogus AltNets to be remembered.

Ackless messages no longer merge as duplicates in a Chat window if > 30 seconds newer (helps separate query responses, at least over APRS-IS)

Correct Compressed location generation to be more spec-compliant as well as support aprs.fi's parser interpretation of a csT where the c is blank. A single trailing blank for c will still be supported by the incoming APRSISCE/32 parser (length is 2 bytes shorter and no infomation is lost), but such packets will not be generated by APRSISCE/32 and such packets would still be flagged as unsupported by aprs.fi.  (Hessu)

Another AutoReply fix that was causing auto-replies to still be issued to non-ack-requested messages (like AA's to ANSRVR announcements!)

Sort the Trace Log list in Enables / Logging & View Logs as well as the right click popup menu.

Eliminate speed limits on station movements if the station was seen at 0,0 (VE7GDH)

Corrected digi-flagging that was busted for "used" digi entries in the path.  (James VE6SRV)

Fixed detection of Yaesu Mic-E devices (busted when interpreting Mic-E telemetry which conflicts with Yaeus's Mic-E type code).  (Julian G4ILO)

Corrected station hourly counts display for Windows Mobile.  (Kevin W7BOZ)

Strip trailing spaces off of items and objects so that they are Screen / Follow / Find-able

Fixed (hopefully) the Screen / Follow / Find of case-insensitively-matched, single object stations.



Internal Cleanups:

Removed a few unnecessary \r\n from outbound packets.  RF ports provide line delimiters if necessary.

Recognize Kenwood's new TH-D72 as a valid Platform

Recognize newly assigned APOAxx as OpenAPRS (which, incidentally, should soon start acking messages thanks to Greg NV6G (it's developer)'s efforts)

Most of you probably haven't noticed this, but if you have multiple messages of different types (Me, My, Internal, Group, Special, Eavesdrop) waiting, they're sorted by type in the initial popup, but time in the chat window.  They are now time-sorted in both.  (Problem most occured with both My and Eavesdrop enabled)

Close Stations popup now includes Track aging hours.

Default for Telemetry enable is FALSE on Win32, but still TRUE on WinMo

Remove leading and trailing spaces from Callsigns in Configuration, Send Message, and Find Station dialogs.

Remove all spaces from Passwords and AltNets.

Disallow NOCALL-SSID as a callsign during configuration.  I can't truly require an amateur callsign, but I can require more creativity!

Respond with better text if no stations in response to ?APRSD/L/H

When a MultiTrack window is closed, remove the buddy/friend filter immediately (James VE6SRV)

Change View / Ambiguity to use rectangles instead of circles, cheaper to draw and (apparently) more accurate of a portrayal.

Change Ambiguity presentation back to the original circle per "Plotting Position Ambiguity" in http://aprs.org/symbols.html  (Bob WB4APR)

Force a transmission when the Configure / Beacon / Precision is changed

Include actual port IGate/Xmit enable status in ?IGATE response strings (Kevin W7BOZ)

Purge bulletins (Hours) and Telemetry Definitions (Days) with configurable intervals - Show on Station Count popup

Treat any message that contains one of the 4 Telemetry definitions (PARM, UNIT, EQNS, BITS) as telemetry definitions (not required to be from/to self). (N6VUD->K6CDF-8)

If View / EchoLinks is already checked, you are asked if you want to Refresh or Remove EchoLinks if you select it again.  Note: View / All is only turned off the first time you View / EchoLinks, not when you Refresh.

If your Configure / General / Range is zero, View / EchoLinks warns that you may not see any EchoLinks depending on your other filters.

Debug messages sent to KJ4ERJ-DB (Development version only) now include 32 vs CE so I know which platform is having what issue and how often.

Moved Screen / Map / Prefetch to Configure / Map / Prefetch as this sounds more like configuration that screen manipulation.

Verious configuration changes (mostly menu-driven, not dialog-driven ones) are now defered 60 seconds to keep the user from having to wait for the configuration file to save.

New View / Transport sub menu for RF Only, RF + -IS, -IS Only, Digipeater, and IGate view filters based on what has been observed in the station's packets paths.  Some of these moved from the RF menu where they really didn't belong.

t/n (NWS info) is now a supported filter element based on the definition provided by Roger Bille (SM5NRK) on 1/11/2011, namely: a) Fromcall has 6 alphabetic characters and b) Sequencenumber (after '{') has 5 alphanumeric characters.

My parser now properly flags NWS messages as NWS for the purposes of the t/n internal filter.  There's some issues with the APRS-IS t/n filter and Pete doesn't recommend its use.  So, a * NWS Office may not get you everything, but my automatic filter (now p/XXX instead of b/XXX*) for a specified office 3 character prefix should work with all known NWS-type alert sources (USA and Australia at the moment).

MultiLine objects are now drawn to my best interpretation of the spec from http://www.aprs-is.net/WX/MultilineProtocol.aspx - And fixed compliments of feedback from the xastir group (Tom KM5VY)

Enforce callsign entry fields to be at most 9 characters, like the Object configuration dialog, rather than truncating on transmission.  (VK2BAC Adrian)

Changed >IGATE capabilities to say "RO!" instead of the more verbose "RECEIVE-ONLY!" since this is transmitted periodically.  (Rick KD4DRA)

Station Information dialog no longer asks "Send message" with Yes/No buttons, but instead offers a single "Chat" button if messaging appears to be supported by the remote station.

Default new object time format is now DHMz as that seems to be more widely accepted than HMSh.

The automatic filter will add both a b/XXXX and an o/XXXX for any window that is Awaiting(XXXX) as we don't know if it'll be a station or an object (hopefully Items get picked up by o/XXXX).

If a window is tracking an object, the Range menu option will not be present and the automatic filter will be an o/XXX, not a b/XXX nor f/XXX/range

Removed ?APRS? and ?IGATE? from the supported queries response pending implementation of actually supporting general (as opposed to directed) queries.

The current client version is included in a message to KJ4ERJ-DB before the first timing debug message is sent (Development version only).

MultiTrack windows now support View / EchoLinks and Geocaches but only based on the information being available via the main window

Configuration saving is now defered for up to 60 seconds to allow crisper user interaction without delays
OSM Cache bitmap instead of tile parts

New/Local/All popup display similar to D710 when packets are received
Implement a compass direction/distance screen for homing in on GeoCaches or Stations / Objects
You already have the ability to click on an object and the program will tell you how far away it is, and in what direction.  Could you also include a computation for how long it would take to get to the object from where you are?  This would be strictly in a vector sense (no expectation of following roads on the map - I know that's not possible), based on your current velocity and direction.  A graphic of the direction instead of the 16-point compass rose designation would also be good.  ("10 minutes, THAT way.") (Greg KO6TH)
The final feature would be to chain a set of objects in a row, as a rudimentary path from, say, aid station 1, to aid station 2, to aid station 3, and so forth.  The time to an object would be computed from the sum of each segment between where you are and the object of interest and your current headway to the first one.  I know this borders on functionality in a modern GPS, but the key difference is that the objects (waypoints in GPS-speak) can be either ones you set, or ones that others set via APRS.  As tactical things change in the APRS space, your target and path can change in real time to follow.  So now if I need to pick up something from Sam, and then Sally, I can enter their SSIDs into a chain and find them even if they move, stopping off at the canteen (private object) on the way back. (Greg KO6TH)

G6UIM - 9/13/2010 5:56pm
Hi all

Have been chatting with our glorious leader (thats Lynn) about a satellite mode. I will see if I can remember 
all that was said in email and over APRS and put down here for thoughts and comments.

I have been trying to get a contact via the ISS using APRSIS32 and at the moment I have to shut off the IS 
feed to get a message to go via RF. Not ideal as I would like to gate received messages over IS for others.

So with this in mind I came up with the following thoughts

Sat Mode:
Summary:
Gate all But not your own messages
Possible option to allow a buddy to use your station to attempt a Sat contact.
use hearing your own message back from the Sat as an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you dont tie up the Sat and give others a chance.
Show RF vs IS messages in Chat, Colorization?  Text?  Symbol <>?
Configurable default to NoAck chats (for satellite instances)


Details... 

Only thought about using one RF port so thoughts on having a Sat specific port in a multiport setup would be good.

Force the message over an RF port and not via IS. So the station you are trying to contact will receive the 
message hopefully via Satellite and not via IS from you.

Gate received messages from the RF port to IS so you are a help to others as an RX SGATE. 

Do not gate messages received on IS to RF as flooding the Sat with messages is not helpful. 

A reasonable retry rate as getting into the Sat can be hard, it will hear lots of stations that you wont so 
TX collisions are inevitable, and you have a limited time. use hearing your own message back from the Sat as 
an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you dont tie up the Sat and give others a chance.

Also either ignore messages over IS or highlight they came from either IS or RF so you can see you made a 
contact over the Sat.

Am sure I have forgotten to add a few things above. And have stated the obvious a bit in places.

Thoughts on the above would be good.

Steve
G6UIM

Who is sure Lynn is going to hard code a ban on his callsign sometime soon

9/14/2010 6:13am

 You could take that further why use radio at all, I have the internet on my phone, and a phone on my err phone. 
And people do ask why I bother with CB

Well maybe not a special port.

I agree on the manual send and abort, the ability to keep clicking send until you get a reply then kill the 
message would be good (with ack turned off).

Although the auto retry and except digi as an ack would be good in some instances, or at least a warning a digi 
was received.

At the moment I use 2 instances of aprsis one with IS turned off that I use to transmit and the other with IS 
turned on to see if anyone has received me.

I could do it with one, with what I was suggesting and also be able to gate received stations to IS.

It's another example of the absurdity of our hobby. Why would you want to send a message to someone by bouncing 
it off a satellite when you are both connected to the internet anyway?  :)  Just to see if it is possible. Which 
is why I would agree with Steve that it would be useful to have an option to prevent beacons and messages 
originated by you from being sent to -IS whilst still allowing messages received over RF to be gated.

I'm not sure what the purpose of a special satellite port would be. When I operate through the ISS I'm using my 
normal 2m setup tuned to the satellite frequency. I run a separate copy of APRSISCE/32 with its own XML file 
containing the satellite beacon text, path with RS0ISS-4, increased beacon frequency etc.

There were a couple of features I would like to see in a "satellite mode" which I kept quiet about because I 
figured they were not really a top priority. Now I'm not sure if I could remember them all.

I would prefer messaging in satellite mode to default to "no ack". You don't always remember to untick the ack 
box and you don't really want people trying to ack back through the space station.

Rather than have a message resent automatically at frequent intervals as Steve suggested I would prefer to 
control the sending manually so I can try to pick the right moment to send it. So what I would like is for 
the text of the message not to disappear when it is sent so I can try again without having to retype it.

None of these suggestions make any sense in the context of "normal" APRS so I would understand if it was felt 
that it was not appropriate for APRSISCE to support them.

Hi Lynn,

Had a re think.

I like the idea of the manual send rather than auto. So basically an ack less message box, you type the message 
in and it gets sent when you click send, but the the message still displays on screen and gets sent again when 
you click send. You need to manually remove the box.

Obviously send the message only via RF.

Keep the IS fully functional apart from not gating IS to RF.

My original thought was not receive messages from IS but thats bad as blocks messages that might get sent from others.

So 3 message receive modes.

Receive all messages however they arrive, for when you dont mind if the message comes direct from the sat or is 
gated onto IS by another station. Or direct from the other station.

Dont display messages on IS from the station/s you are trying to send to via the sat. for when you want an RF 
only QSO with the station but still want to receive from others.

Dont display any message that comes in on IS. (perhaps they could be stored and displayed when out of sat mode)

Have this configurable on a port basis as some people might want to have a radio on the normal APRS freq and 
another running for Satellites. Would need path and beacon on a port by port basis.

More notes from 2010/12/13:

Hi Lynn,

My thoughts, for whatever they're worth...
What I miss is simply a list of stations heard and their status and other data, in reverse order of receipt.  
The three item list in the upper left corner is barely long enough to see something of interest when you're 
watching the screen.  It's useless for this purpose if you turn you attention elsewhere for even a moment.  
My Kenwood TH-D7 has, effectively, both forms.  When a station is heard, it's displayed on the front panel 
and announced with a cheerful beep.  A quick flick of the stick and you can see the details.  Or, you can hit 
the List button and scroll back through time to review the last 40 events.

I suppose your design intent is that if you want to see what's going on around you, you'd just look at the map.  
Whether fed from RF or IS, objects appear on the map as received, and if you click on them, all the data gets 
displayed.  The problem is that events of some (mild) interest often occur off-map, and looking at a map gives 
little to no clue at the age of the data.  Yes, slowly graying out a station helps here, but there's no sequence 
information which could be useful in the field.  While I am annoyed when my D7 cheerfully beeps and informs me 
of a wide-too-many station's beacon dutifully digipeated from hundreds of miles away, I am also informed by 
weather information from the region beyond the bounds of my typical monitoring area.  Periodically zooming the 
map out (polling) to see if anything is there is a less effective than requesting (pulling) a list of the last 
50 or so events. 

For me, the particular call sign is less important as an initial sort; reverse time order (newest first) is better.
Then, I might request a sort by call sign or distance from me.  I think this is also best from a CPU load perspective.

Given the large set of entries from the IS feed, I would probably want to not save station information if they 
were more than some distance from me (configurable, of course).  Information without a position included would 
only be seen in the screen event scroll.  This should keep the list from being flushed through with locally 
irrelevant events too quickly.
Greg  KO6TH

I agree Greg, And adding the ability to apply the current filter (ie distance) and perhaps even a list# limit 
of say 100 stations. This would present me a list of the last 100 stations in the local 50 miles and NOT a 
complete list of Lynn's 17,000.

I think this would be useful and is used on all the Kenwood and Yaesu APRS radios.




12/30/2010 10:59am - Queries from Keih VE7GDH

Looking at the HELP from UI-View...

APRS Queries
UI-View32 supports the following APRS query messages. To send one
of these queries to another station, simply key it in like a normal message.
When receiving a query, UI-View32 responds as follows:-

?APRSP - sends a location beacon.
?APRSS - sends the status text.
?APRSO - sends your active objects.
?APRSD - sends a list of stations that have been heard direct.
?APRST (or ?PING?) - sends the route by which the query was received.
?APRSH <callsign> - sends information on when <callsign> was last heard.
?VER? (not an APRS query, but some APRS software supports it) - sends
             information on the software version in use.

Note that queries and responses are one-off transmissions.
They are not retried and are not acknowledged.

2011/01/16 10:42am [aprsisce] Re: Tiny Web Pages

I would like to do something like this but I have no desire to run UI-View in order to do it. I did have a conversation with Lynn a few days ago about possible ways of doing it. I don't think it would be very easy to implement as a standalone program that connects to APRS-IS. At the least I think you would need a managed interface with APRSISCE/32 that would provide the third party add-in with information such as the position of the station wanting to get information and the commands they are sending. At best all the functionality would be in APRSISCE/32 itself and all the user had to do is provide the information.

1/16/2011 - 11:12am Re: [aprsisce] Re: AVRS

Now Lynn, all you need to do on the Kenwood interface is to auto-tune
the other side of the radio automatically when an AVRS request comes
in.

After talking with Bob about AVRS at Dayton waaaay back, I came home
and started playing with my D700 and simulated the AVRS functionality
with a terminal program. I came up with some conceptual settings for
operation.

Full manual: What you have right now, a message pops up telling you a
call is coming in on repeater XXX.
Semi Auto: Message comes in with a TUNE(able) frequency embedded, and
you simply need to hit the TUNE button.
Full Auto: Message comes in, pops up on screen and the other side of
the radio automatically tunes to the frequency.

Oh yeah, this was before the QSY function (inserting the other side
frequency into the position report) or TUNE functions were around
either. Those were functions that I was playing with as well, just had
no way to implement them. (There are a few concepts that I shared with
Bob that I think sparked some ideas...)

APRSISCE/32 could be the first on the block to be able to do the three
AVRS QSY modes.

Lynn can you set some thing up that will tell how far the stations are from me just by moving the mouse over to the station
Also is their a way that an old man with an eye and a half can change the coller of his station in the scroll windo so that I can see it when it beaconds
If you cand no big thing
Thank you
