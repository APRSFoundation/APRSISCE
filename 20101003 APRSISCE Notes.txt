Here's what's new in the APRSISCE6P-101003.zip and APRSIS32-101003.zip

About version is 2010/10/03 07:30

MULTITRACK!  - nuff said?  Not really...

	Access via Station popup menu - MultiTrack option - Only on APRSIS32, no Windows Mobile for obvious screen estate limitations

	Set window's Size, Zoom (Up/Down) and Transparency (Left/Right) then hit Preferred / Percent or Size or Zoom (Screen / Preferred / MultiTrack / ... on Main Window)

	Windows are initially centered and tracking the original station with a Buddy filter

	To get a Friend Filter (if Range is non-zero) hit the Range option in the MultiTrack window's station popup menu (limited to 6 by APRS-IS server filters)

	Right click on empty map space menu shows all MultiTrack and Main windows for direct access

	There is a limited number of these windows allowed, currently 6 (including Main) with Range tracking or 8 total Windows (including Main)

APRSISCE/32 now parses and displays APRS weather (the 3 most popular formats) and displays it in the station popup.  At least it's not in the comment any more!  And there's new Configure / Metric options to go with it along with View / Label / Weather to show Temp and Windspeed/Direction.

APRSISCE/32 supports ANSRVR, an announcement server that can be used similar to CQSRVR, but allows lurking quietly to listen for announcements.  Check out Messages / Announcements / Active Groups to see what's available.  Or Messages / Announcment / Join Group and make your own!

Status Reports (APRS dataytype >) are now supported via Configure / Status... and the Configure / Status Report cascading menu.

	Enabled - Status reports won't transmit unless enabled

	GridSquare - The APRS Spec (pages 81-82, 91-92 in aprs101.pdf) provides for GridSquare to be transmitted as status

	Timestamp - Includes the current ddhhmmz timestamp in the status update, suppressed if GridSquare is checked.

	Status report / Status - The text to transmit, also available via cascading menu

	Interval - The time in minutes between transmissions.  0 will also disable.

	On the cascading menu, New will let you set a new status text while None will disable transmission of status.

Comment Interval (Configure / Status...) allows you to specify a time range for including the Beacon Comment on position updates.  Configure / Status... has Beacon Comment / Interval where 0 = Always (as it used to be), otherwise the value is in minutes.  The comment is included on Forced (Manual) Transmit, but will only piggy-back on a beacon that is otherwise triggered by Transmit Pressure.

Chat windows on APRSIS32 (not WinMo) Hide when they are closed automatically retaining previous chat contents.  Any new message received from or sent to the same station will restore the populated chat.  To actually close a chat (to get a new one next time), clear it first.

Chat windows now offer a MultiTrack menu option that brings up a MultiTrack window for any callsign that isn't yours (2 windows for eavesdropped chats)

If you click on a detected link in a Chat window, the URL will open in your default browser.  Note that if the URL is split over multiple lines, you'll still have to piece it back together.

You can no longer type a | ~ or { into a chat message.  These are illegal characters in the body of APRS messages per spec.

If you fill the chat outbound box, it will still let you type an Enter to send the message.

Multi-line wrapped messages have a + added to the end to indicate to the recipient that there's more text coming their way.  Eventually, APRSISCE might use this to merge messages together on the limited display.

I've tightened up the Chat display by replacing the (redundant) date/Reply space with a < or > pointing to the side of the conversation that sent the text (this means the chat window is 6 characters narrower by default).  If a date changes in a chat, a line is inserted to tell you that.  (Who wants to stay up across midnight to test that for me?)

Corrected a bug causing message-only stations to be forgotten quickly eliminating the ability for Reply-Ack to work.

Also corrected a bug causing all non-SSID'd message recipients to appear as "My Messages" (thanks to SQ5NWI for reporting this one)

New "Clear" menu with the old "Clear Tracks" and new "Clear Stations" that drops all but buddies and the center station.  A bunch of other Clears have moved here as well.

Configure / Screen / Labels / "Not Me" and "Not Mine" allow you to suppress your stations' callsigns from the display even if Screen / Labels / Callsign is checked.  Many times, you know where your own stations are!  (sort of Fred N7FMH)

Configure / Messages now contains My Messages, Eavesdrop (both moved from Messages) and the new Hide Queries, Notify New, and Notify Query so you can eliminate the popup balloons if you so desire.  

When you pop up a single station menu, the most recently received packet for that station is shown at the bottom of the map.  You may have to maximize the window to make this useful.  Maybe some day it will scroll horizontally, but not soon.

The station popup menu now includes the timestamp the most recent packet was heard.  This will probably change to a packet age (d hh:mm:ss Ago) in some future revision.

Single station popup menus now have a cascading "Path" menu showing the path components w/symbols additional cascades if the station is known

The "Me" station popup message box includes the currently connected APRS-IS server IP:Port if connected and different than what is configured (Philip KB5ASY)

All station popups now contain the table and symbol in ASCII characters after Sym: <DesscriptiveName> (TS).  This will make constructing Symbol filters a bit easier.  (sort of Fred N7FMH)

+/- on zoom slider now have boxes around them to help stand out (not sure who suggested it, but thanks)

Some of you may have noticed the square blocks around the station Icons on the task bar and system menu. I've been learning more about transparency and those blocks are now gone.  Any white (RGB(255,255,255)) in the original symbol is now made transparent just as it is when displaying the symbol at 100% intensity on the map.  Now I need to tackle making it fade away transparently (it currently gets a ghosty rectangle around it as it fades away).

Brace yourself, the world really isn't a rectangle, but a continuous east/west flow.  If you drag west of Hawaaii, you find Japan.  If you drag east of Australia/New Zealand, you find South America!  If you zoom way out, you can see multiple worlds, but only once instance of each station where it would be closest to center.  There is still a N/S boundary though as OSM (and APRSISCE/32) only goes +/- 85.0511 degrees (arctan(sinh(pi)) - See http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames#X_and_Y and the bottom of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection#Uses).  If you're venturing outside that limit, please take someone else's APRS software with you!  (or take me along so I can test the behavior and make it work, all expenses paid, of course!)

Improved paint performance of the background map, the scrolling station icons, and the map icons.  Please see if your CPU is running more idle and let me know.  My map painting seemed about 50% faster (20% down to 10%) as I cache bigger maps rather than continuously assembling the individual tiles.  It improved yet again when I cached the overlayed symbol images.  Previously it jittered the overlay character and drew it about 10 times for EVERY icon repaint.

I've further improved the paint performance of faded maps (<95%) by doing the fade while assembling the tiles rather than while putting the large map to the screen.  This is now a 2msec operation instead of 20msec on Win32.  On WinMo, it's 2msec instead of 400-800msec!

Address lookup is now asynchronous on a free-running thread.  You can continue to work until the answer comes in at which time the (modal) message box will appear.

When a telemetry update is received, refrsh the timestamp of any telemetry definitions for that station to keep them around longer.  Note, the timestamp is not necessarily when the definitions were received, but when they were most recently considered "useful" as in the station is still sending telemetry.

Telemetry Definitions now purge if they are not referenced after a long period of time (default 14 days).  You can also dump all of them on the floor (not recommended if you use the Telemetry popup) via Clear / Clear Telemetry.

Bulletins now purge if they are not refreshed after a configurable period of time (default 48 hours).  You can clear them all via Clear / Clear Bulletins or the Clear menu option on the bulletins window itself.

Buddy stations can now be configured to purge with age instead of hovering at 5%.  They still fade based on <Stations.MaxAge>, but will delete after <Stations.MaxAge.Buddy> (default 0 for unlimited as before).

Track points will now purge even if the owning station remains active.  There are two parameters for this, one for Buddy tracks and the other for non-buddies.  A value of 0 retains them forever.  Buddies default to 0 (unlimited) and others are 24 hours by default.

The <IGATE capabilities packet is no longer generated if APRS-IS is disabled (an RF-Only installation).  The program isn't gating then anyway.  Also, if <IGATE has been transmitted and APRS-IS is disabled, an <IGATE,DISABLED packet will be sent.  (Philip KB5ASY)

That bothersome Xmit checkbox is gone from the TCP/IP and COMM port configuration dialogs.

Fixed the Power Status popup to only display values that Windows doesn't flag as Unavailable (255 in the case of percentage)  (Thanks to Mike WM4B)

Renovated internal window invalidates to prepare for MultiTracking windows.  Let me know if any visual artifacts result.

In some strange instances (like when my phone is tethered to my laptop), noam.aprs2.net translates to some bogus IP addresses ending in .0.  I now ignore these UNLESS every translations ends in .0.  This is only done with DNS-resolved, not explicitly configured IP addresses.

Some of you eavesdroppers have been getting innudated with the "Running" messages sent by KJ4ERJ to KJ4ERJ-12 and noticed that they didn't go away with Messages / Purge Eaves.  This is because these messages were considered "special".  I've fixed it so they'll go back to being eavesdrop messages for everyone but me.

Mucked around with the popup menus as I noticed that they overlap to a high degree on WinMo. I liked how they came out, so all station popup menus will now show the station's call AND comment (if any) along with a separator making them appear to be a "header" on the menu.  This way, if you can see the menu, you know who it's for even if it covered the parent menu item that brought it up (like a multi-station selection or a Path menu).

The "Path" menu now shows the accurate hop count for the displayed path at the end (after a new separator).  It will also include the "Best" hops if it is different than the displayed Path.  This happens when multiple digi'd packets are received, the last one's path is shown, but there may have been a better (fewer used hops) earlier.

If Configure / Beacon / Comment was used to select or enter a new comment, the "ME" station popup did not reflect the change.  It does now.  (Julian G4ILO)

There is also a Clear / Beacon Comments that will clear ALL remembered comments except the one that may be currently in use (Steve G6UIM)

Genius Beacon settings now support "Time Only" (Default off, which completely bases beacons on Max Time) and "Start/Stop" (Default On, which can disable the start/stop beacon triggers for those that drive in traffic) (Peter Scheltema and ???)

If an instance with objects and/or bulletins was down for a while, when it came up, it would burst out all overdue objects and bulletins.  This has been tempered to only allow one Object and one Bulletin over RF per 30 second window.  If an Object or Bulletin is edited and changed (or a new one is created), all pending objects and bulletins are allowed to transmit regardless of -IS or RF.

Object kill flags were being parsed, but only recognized if it was a kill on the first definition of the object.  This has been fixed to recognize a kill on subsequent packets and remove the object from the screen.  (Steve AB3LT)

The zoom slider and the width of the power and close stations bars is now based on the width of a standard vertical scroll bar via GetSystemMetrics().  This may be wider than before, but is not allowed to get narrower than my previous hard-coded 15 pixels.  (Robin)

If you have Configure / Screen / GridSquare checked to see the screen center grid square in the lower left corner, you will now see grid square outlines at 45% and 95% opacity.  The left/right arrows adjust by 5% for each increment, but don't worry, if you see the grid square, you can't help but notice the outlines when they appear unless you're zoomed WAY up close.  Zoom levels 0 through 4 show 2 character squares (unlabelled), 5 through 9 show 4 character squares, and 10 and higher show 6 character squares.

Parsing of the !xxxx! texts from http://aprs.org/aprs12/EmergencyCode.txt into the MicE status string, no notifications yet, though.

?APRSS now triggers an immediate status report transmission in addition to returning the configured port status and traffic rates (Randy WF5X)

APRSISCE (WinMo) now offers to save enabled trace logs "Always" for things like RF Port logs.  The only way to remove an Always is editing the XML file.

APRSISCE (WinMo) now tracks phone operator and quality status in the APRS-IS OK rotating status display. This status is also reported in the ?APRST query response.  The Quality value is also reported in the Telemetry if enabled.

APRSISCE (WinMo) can now enable or disable a Trace Log while viewing it.  This is good if you open APRS-IS trace log to check IP addresses.  Disable it or it will grow quickly.  APRSISCE can also clear and copy the trace log.  In a few development releases, the menu covered the horizontal scroll bar, but this is now fixed.

APRSISCE (WinMo) chat windows are now titled based on the "other" (not Me) callsign.  The "FromCall <-> ToCall" title is just too wide for portrait mobile devices.

APRSISCE (WinMo) now properly clears the green message waiting indicator when you click on it to open a hidden Chat.  All pending shell notifications are also cleared simply by opening the chat.

APRSISCE (WinMo) now pans a bit quicker due to the caching of the assembled map.  Also, if it does need to reload the map, it will switch the transparency off as it can pan smoother in that mode.  It will automatically restore the transparency when the drag operation is complete.

MAJOR CHANGE (For Trace Log Users): APRSISCE/32 no longer automatically enables a Trace Log just by viewing it.  The menu option will say "Enable" if it is disabled and "Disable" if it is enabled.  You must manually enable the log after viewing if you expect to see new stuff.  This was done to allow viewing of "Forced" trace log information without be instantly flooded by the non-forced (must be enabled) information.  Enables / View Logs / All still enables all logs.  Enables / Logging / All OFF will turn them all off.

During initial installation (First Run), the following streamline changes have been made: (Bill WA7NWP)
	1) Can now Cancel out of initial callsign configuration dialog, program exits with a message (will not run with NOCALL)
	2) The OSMTiles directory is automatically created as a subdirectory under the current default directory (no prompting).
	3) The "Drag and Zoom to Home" now accepts Transmit as a way out and doesn't require restarting the client
	4) Zoom checks are done to ensure that they are at least at a reasonably detailed zoom level before accepting a location.

The new fresh installation startup sequence is now:
	1) Double-click APRSIS32.EXE
	2) Enter callsign-SSID and press Enter or click Accept
	3) Drag and zoom to find "Home" and click Transmit (prompt remains at bottom of screen)
	4) Done.  Up and running and watching the APRS world.

<View.Metric.Windspeed> - Display Windspeed in knots vs mph/kph
<View.Weather> - Includes Temp/Wind as Label for stations that have it

Performance enhancements including:
OSM Map is now built from panes large enough for the screen.  This larger map is now blt'd onto the screen for station addition during the paint instead of drawing from the original tiles.
OSM Tile Cache is now also multiple panes in size rather than a bitmap per pane to reduce Windows resource consumption and improve performance
Panning is improved on APRSISCE by switching map transparency off if the map needs to be reloaded.  Transparency takes LOTS longer w/o hardware acceleration.
Serious performance improvement in locating stations in the station list for updating when packets are received.  qsort/bsearch rather than a linear search of 2 9-character strings in a list of 10-20,000 elements.
Instead of drawing overlay characters on each station every time it paints, I now cache pre-written symbols.  This also allows me to paint them faded without having a BOLD overlay character.

G6UIM - 9/13/2010 5:56pm
Hi all

Have been chatting with our glorious leader (that’s Lynn) about a satellite mode. I will see if I can remember all that was said in email and over APRS and put down here for thoughts and comments.

 

I have been trying to get a contact via the ISS using APRSIS32 and at the moment I have to shut off the IS feed to get a message to go via RF. Not ideal as I would like to gate received messages over IS for others.

So with this in mind I came up with the following thoughts

 

Sat Mode

 

Only thought about using one RF port so thoughts on having a Sat specific port in a multiport setup would be good.

 

Force the message over an RF port and not via IS. So the station you are trying to contact will receive the message hopefully via Satellite and not via IS from you.

Gate received messages from the RF port to IS so you are a help to others as an RX SGATE. But not your own messages

Do not gate messages received on IS to RF as flooding the Sat with messages is not helpful. Possible option to allow a buddy to use your station to attempt a Sat contact.

A reasonable retry rate as getting into the Sat can be hard, it will hear lots of stations that you won’t so TX collisions are inevitable, and you have a limited time. use hearing your own message back from the Sat as an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you don’t tie up the Sat and give others a chance.

Also either ignore messages over IS or highlight they came from either IS or RF so you can see you made a contact over the Sat.

 

Am sure I have forgotten to add a few things above. And have stated the obvious a bit in places.

 

Thoughts on the above would be good.

Who is sure Lynn is going to hard code a ban on his callsign sometime soon

 You could take that further why use radio at all, I have the internet on my phone, and a phone on my err phone. And people do ask why I bother with “CB”

Well maybe not a special port.

I agree on the manual send and abort, the ability to keep clicking send until you get a reply then kill the message would be good (with ack turned off).

Although the auto retry and except digi as an ack would be good in some instances, or at least a warning a digi was received.

At the moment I use 2 instances of aprsis one with IS turned off that I use to transmit and the other with IS turned on to see if anyone has received me.

I could do it with one, with what I was suggesting and also be able to gate received stations to IS.

G4ILO - 9/14/2010 4:16am
It's another example of the absurdity of our hobby. Why would you want to send a message to someone by bouncing it off a satellite when you are both connected to the internet anyway?  :)  Just to see if it is possible. Which is why I would agree with Steve that it would be useful to have an option to prevent beacons and messages originated by you from being sent to -IS whilst still allowing messages received over RF to be gated.

I'm not sure what the purpose of a special satellite port would be. When I operate through the ISS I'm using my normal 2m setup tuned to the satellite frequency. I run a separate copy of APRSISCE/32 with its own XML file containing the satellite beacon text, path with RS0ISS-4, increased beacon frequency etc.

There were a couple of features I would like to see in a "satellite mode" which I kept quiet about because I figured they were not really a top priority. Now I'm not sure if I could remember them all.

I would prefer messaging in satellite mode to default to "no ack". You don't always remember to untick the ack box and you don't really want people trying to ack back through the space station.

Rather than have a message resent automatically at frequent intervals as Steve suggested I would prefer to control the sending manually so I can try to pick the right moment to send it. So what I would like is for the text of the message not to disappear when it is sent so I can try again without having to retype it.

None of these suggestions make any sense in the context of "normal" APRS so I would understand if it was felt that it was not appropriate for APRSISCE to support them.

Julian, G4ILO

G6UIM - 9/14/2010 12:00pm

Hi Lynn,

Had a re think.

I like the idea of the manual send rather than auto. So basically an ack less message box, you type the message in and it gets sent when you click send, but the the message still displays on screen and gets sent again when you click send. You need to manually remove the box.

Obviously send the message only via RF.

Keep the IS fully functional apart from not gating IS to RF.

My original thought was not receive messages from IS but that’s bad as blocks messages that might get sent from others.

So 3 message receive modes.

Receive all messages however they arrive, for when you don’t mind if the message comes direct from the sat or is gated onto IS by another station. Or direct from the other station.

Don’t display messages on IS from the station/s you are trying to send to via the sat. for when you want an RF only QSO with the station but still want to receive from others.

Don’t display any message that comes in on IS. (perhaps they could be stored and displayed when out of sat mode)

Have this configurable on a port basis as some people might want to have a radio on the normal APRS freq and another running for Satellites. Would need path and beacon on a port by port basis.

APRSISCE
GEETING STARTED

APRSISCE is downloaded as a zip file, Unzip the contents of this file to a Directory Name of your choice maybe “APRSISCE”.

Now run the APRSISCE program, you will see a box to enter your callsign,  click on the symbol to change to symbol of your choice, enter your password for the aprs server connection, (if you don't have one send email to KJ4ERJ@arrl.net  with your name and call to get one) now at this point you are ready to go to map, and you can fine tune the other settings later. Now click Accept

The next step is setting your Location, very important step...

The box tells you zoom and drag to your location click OK, now you see a very small map, you need to zoom this map, you should see your symbol on the map center but very small, keep in mind that if you zoom too fast you will lose site of your symbol. So just zoom in small increments and drag the map to your station, (you're not dragging your station). 

Keep zooming til you get to street level in your neighborhood and place your station.

That's it, now close the program and reopen and you should be centered on your station.

Hope you enjoy the Program
