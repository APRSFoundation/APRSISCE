Here's what's new in the APRSISCE6P100319.zip and APRSIS32100319.zip

If Altitude is followed by a numeric character, put a space between to make the conversion obvious (SQ9MLI-9)

Fix parser so that it only parses 6 digit /A= elements even if it is followed by a numeric character (SQ9MLI-9)

Put locks around some multi-threaded file access to fix a debug alert popup.  (Fred N7FMH)

Put icon on task bar for restoring window.  Use baloon popup when a new message is received (with sound if enabled).

Correct speed width measure to account for Knots->mph rounded so that it works correctly when approaching 100mph (KJ4DXK)

Slow down random beaconing due to heading change by ignoring it if we weren't and/or aren't moving at least 0.5 knot (eventually configurable)

Don't forecast a projected position (red dot) unless we had a previous heading AND were moving.

Support custom ?IGATE (note the lack of the trailing ? from the aprs101.pdf spec) to get back a response with the non-zero <IGATE information in addition to supporting ?IGATE? to trigger a transmission of the <IGATE.

Discovered that sometimes the Time pressure can go negative by 1 second.  Fixed to min at 0.

Support !DAO! extra precision digits in beacon transmissions (http://www.aprs.org/aprs12/datum.txt).  You can configure this as 0 (default), 1, or 2 in <Beacon.DAO>.

Support custom components of the beacon via <Beacon.*> XML settings (0=no, 1=yes) (Timestamp, HHMMSS (vs DDHHMM), CourseSpeed, Altitude, Comment).

Support optional transmission of Transmit Pressure as reason for a position beacon (<Beacon.Why> set to 1).

Allow configuration <View.DateTime> of date/time display (None=0) & GMT (=2) vs local (=1, Default) (Dave N8PU)

Make MOVING_SPEED (currently 0.5 knot) configurable <MoveSpeed> in Knots (triggers Start/Stop and Projections)

If a callsign is configured as -0 (or a Message To:), strip off the -0 as it is redundant and misleading when it comes to messaging (Steve G6UIM)

Strip off -0 and treat -0 as the same as no -SSID.  (Steve G6UIM)

Receive all messages for base callsign, ack only matching -SSID, only if Messages / My Messages is turned on.  This also adds a b/call(no-SSDI)* filter to receive all of your messages from APRS-IS.  Message popup will identify who the message was addressed to ("Reply For callsign-SSID?")

Record Telemetry index in config file on shutdown to avoid duplicates on restart

No longer include Lat/Lon in UDP usage packet if Tracking is not enabled.  (Unnecessary, given the next one)

Remove UDP packet when GPS fix is acquired (no more phone home).  There's plenty of users now for me to continue.  There's still one UDP packet only to track version number, not coordinates.

Added Mutex locking around Trace logging as protection for eventual log capture and viewing and to prevent crashing when panning/fetching quickly.




To Dos:  (Still Incomplete and getting LONGER instead of SHORTER!)

-IS to RF gate functionality to a) gate none (as it does today), b) gate all messages to stations "recently" "heard" locally, or c) gate only Acks to stations from whom a message was recently received (and said ack not heard via RF yet after a short random delay?).  C would accomplish a PSK-63 initiated QSO without risking flooding the channel with stuff that doesn't need to be there.

Capturing a debug log:
1) Bring up the client
2) Turn on Enables / Debug Logging
3) Close the client
4) Bring up the client
5) Wait for a while, then do a screen capture (if you know how) or at 
least note what it says in the APRS Status window (Top center 
(View/Map/Wide) or 2'nd down on the left (View/Map/Narrow))
6) Close the client
