Here's what's new in the APRSISCE6P100301.zip and APRSIS32100301.zip

Short List (well, maybe not so short):

With GPS Disabled (or not configured), Clicking Transmit will ask if you want to move to the screen center.  This will let you move your coordinates around after the original setup without editing the XML file!

Bottom of circle shows Center/Tracking status (S is tracking me to center)

Screen / Tracking menu options to a) Re-center on Tracked station, b) Track and Center Me, c) Lock tracking (drag is cancelled on position update, forces tracked station back to center)

If you were tracking a station when you close the program, it will wait for that station to appear and auto-track it on restart.  Track something else to cancel.

If a message or ack is heard from a station, that station will be marked as "Message Capable" adding Message and Yes/No to the menu/popup respectively.

Messages now gate from -IS to RF as 3rd party packets if the destinatino station was "recently" heard "locally".  They are currently sent on ALL enabled RF interfaces (although AGW is still receive-only)

A rolling window of 10 APRSISxx.LOG files is saved.  01 through 09 is appended to the name for the older logs.  Please zip and send ALL of them if you have support requests!

When an RF interface is enabled, the scrolling station pane wasn't sizing wide enough for the *n suffix for RF-received packets.  It does now.

The XML configuration saver can now handle an & symbol or overlay!

The program can now properly format !DAO! extended precision beacons.  They'll be configurable in a future revision but are currently used for RFID beacons.

View / RFID will filter the display to stations with HA or RA symbols (Box overlayed with H or R) for RFID

Non-GPS beacons were going out with a 000000h timestamp. The beacon now includes the system's time in UTC.




To Dos:  (Still Incomplete and getting LONGER instead of SHORTER!)
