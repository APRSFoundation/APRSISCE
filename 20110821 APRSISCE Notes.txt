Here's the major features in APRSISCE6P110821.zip and APRSIS32110821.zip

About version is 2011/08/21 16:57

Application identifier is still APWW/APWM08


Here's the details for APRSISCE6P110821.zip and APRSIS32110821.zip

1) Previously released fix for the over-zealous automatic r/lat/lon/range filters for MultiTracks.

2) "RANGING" should not be showing up in the main window any more.  It is ALWAYS ranging!

3) "Center" on a station's popup menu no longer clears the center to jump back to ME.  It now always centers on the station whose popup menu it is found on, whether checked or not.  Use "Center ME" or Screen / Follow / ME to start following your own station.

And everything below this line was in the (barely) previous relase from 2011/08/20

(My apologies for not crediting those that helped identify and test these features.  My book-keeping has gotten a bit lax with busy-ness, but I am deeply indebted to each and every one of you.)

Added range and bearing to ?APRSD response

Support adopting a View / Echolinks link as a local object (for my trip).

Turn the error beep to a warning beep and do the proper beep for gone vs back.

Removed a bunch of the timing messages being sent to KJ4ERJ-DB.

Force a position beacon whenever the APRS-IS port (re)connects.  This should work around a firenet.us server bust whereby after a restart, ALL weather stations are delivered until a new position beacon is transmitted.

NWS alert messages are detected and instead of offering chat buttons, a View (ShowMe?) button is presented allowing a MultiTrack or the main window to center on the alert area.

Dash and underscore NWS alerts are now merged into a single (counted) duplicate line when the message is viewed.

Hopefully I've fixed a hard-to-detect issue with clearing eavesdropped messages when first viewed instead of once for each end of the chat.

The scrolling station (packet) log will show a # if the station was heard inside a 3rd party packet (ie gated from -IS to RF).  Third-party packets NEVER appear on APRS-IS, only RF, so the # is a superset of *.  (Think # is a number and therefore 3rd)

QRU<callsign> objects are now marked as Mine to honor the Configure / Screen / Label / Callsign / Not Mine option.

Newly nicknamed objects should work without requiring a restart.

Only trigger a status report on a new DX if DX is included in the status report.  Also, don't transmit an empty or timestamp-only Status Report.

Station popup menu now shows elapsed time since packet received instead of absolute time.  Absolute time is still used in the station info popup dialog.

Right Click's Lat/Lon cascading menu now offers MultiTrack and Center Here to popup or center at that point, not just on a station.

Ranging MultiTracks now include an r/lat/lon/range in the filter if they're not tracking me.

Double-clicking on the scale number now alternates between centering on me and the Preferred (if set) view.

If you have a MultiTrack open on ME, it will not be offerered for remembering when APRSISCE/32 is closed.

Add GPS/NMEA checkbox to Port configuration to expect NMEA passthrough on that port.

Extract passthrough NMEA data from KISS (TT4's GKRELAY) and TEXT (KJ4DXK's MiLog/D700's in non-transmitting TNC mode) port types.

Default new NWS Entry Calls to disabled and queue internal message when one is discovered.  Some stations are gating NWS messages to RF from firenet.us without 3rd party wrappers and IGates are appearing to be new NWS sources when those packets are gated back into APRS-IS from.

Suppress thread name from Packets trace log.  This may extend to other less debug-ish trace logs in the future.

Control-L will rotate (increment) the APRSISCE/32nn.LOG file name and start a new un-numbered file.  This is handy to close a log file and start a new one before doing some sort of test or event involving capturing packets or debug to the *.LOG file.

Control-O (Satellite Orbits) now uses the Lat/Lon of ME instead of Lynn's home QTH lat/lon!

Support up to 24 GPS satellites in view.  The default is 12, but the bottom bar's rectangles will shrink and the maximum number simultaneously in view will set the total number of numbers presented.  Once it grows beyond 12, it won't shrinkn as that makes things bounce around rather annoyingly when a variable number >12 are in view.

Don't force errors to <PortName> TraceLog after reconnect delay extends past 60 seconds.  This will prevent runaway growth of .LOG files when disconnected ports are left enabled, especially BlueTooth and D72 ports.

?group objects are now treated like other objects.  If they are enabled w/no Vias, they will display locally.  If they are enabled with a non-zero interval, they will transmit periodically on the enabled Vias as well as on demand.

IStoRF messaging will no longer gate messages that have the IGate station already within the used path components.  (N9ALD-10/KC8SWY/KC9QOV-11)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
            End of Release Notes...ToDo List Follows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The following ToDos were last updated on 1/21/2011
If you've suggested something to be done (and have actually read this far)
and it's not listed below, please re-ask for it and I'll try to get it on
the list this time.

To Dos:  (Still Incomplete and always getting LONGER instead of SHORTER!)

Top item to be done: RF-Port specific tracking and use, Multi-Port AGW Support, UI-View Maps

When disabling an NWS office, ask if it should be removed from the list.  (wellmanl)

DX Trace log shows distances in miles even if Configure / Metric / Distance is checked for Kilometers.

Support a minimum distance and minimum interval for DX classification and >DX transmissions.  (Julian G4ILO)

Auto-Wrap (and highlight?) long received messages in Chat windows to "fix" viewing messages from non-compliant clients.

Allow a single MultiTrack to track multiple stations and keep them visible via auto-zoom.  Use this for the auto-popup of multiple objects received from a QRU response.  (Adam KC2ANT)

Check operation of single-digit directories in the OSM layer.  It may have gotten borked.

Need CWOP (and maybe IS-Server) port-specific Filter overrides, hard-coded or NWS-only...

ANSRVR doesn't re-transmit UTF-8 characters correctly.  It also doesn't support UTF-8 descriptions.

ANSRVR needs to not transmit messages to stations that it hasn't heard beacons from recently.  Pseudo-remove them from their groups, but don't tell them.  When beaconing resumes, wait a "net cycle" time before removing them fully from a group and notifying them.

Support configurability by NWS Product Code of line color/style and/or symbol.

TX/RX light on-screen (Kevin W7BOZ)

Need to flush shapefile caches and/or indices if WM_HIBERNATE is received on WinMo direction applications to free non-essential memory.

Mouse-hover popup describing screen section? (Configurably disabled/time-triggered/re-enablable)
Check cascading popups (RF, Symbols, ...) if any submenu item is checked
Sort stations so most recent is on top for symbols (most recent last) and reverse for labels/altitude (most recent first) for priority placement.
Record and display speed on tracks for selected track, along with altitude.  (additionally/alternatively, display a graph of track's speed(s) and altitude?)
Fix label avoidance region to add icons to region for any subsequenly displayed reason (currently only looks at Screen / Labels / Label).
Include selected labels on all displayed icons, not just the center selected one (optionally!).  Currently only Label (callsign) and altitude are displayed except for centered station.
Detect that Transparency is or is not supported and disable, especially for running under Wine - Ask G4ILO-IX to test

Perform Mic-E alerting functions described at http://aprs.org/aprs12/EmergencyCode.txt
Provide "ignore station" exclusion filters for main display.
Provide filters or selections for what shows up in the srolling station log (particularly the abilility to suppress my generated packets).
Feature request. Click the stations scrolling up on the left and the scrolling stops. I sometimes see a station that might be interesting but can't quite catch the call ssid. almost impossible to click on the station to get info (G6UIM)
Multi-color tracks to tell which is whose (Adrian M0GLJ-12)
Display more than 32 (user-configurable) track boxes and/or length of non-centered stations' tracks.  (Greg  KO6TH)
New (optional) window (view on WinMo) that displays the interpreted most recently received packet.  Maybe formatted like FTM-350 and/or D710 front panels? (Fred N7FMH)
Can We please make APRSIS32 remember the window configuration and which log files where being displayed before and after a restart. (N1NAZ)
So we don't have to go through and reopen the log files we want to view. (N1NAZ)
Also make it possible to Multi-Pick Items in the pull downs using the "control Click" routine. (N1NAZ)
When running an AltNet, only show AltNet packets in the scrolling station log (maybe show all RF, but only AltNet APRS-IS stations?)
Show a stretched or flattened circle (rectangle?) to map to an Nnm range from an ambiguous station.
Scrolling Log - Extra Window Limit to Vislble?  How? Window Private!
CE raw packet display (bottom of map) word-truncates too early
(not very usable on the narrow screen anyway)
MsgBox -> private source file (and others)
Add View filter for AltNets to avoid "using" one accidentally (single bit originally?)
Pan away from Locked Center w/o track doesn't show line!  (zero points...)
User-specified filter criteria on Scrolling Station Log - Exclude Internal?
Remember and recall last views by centered station for MultiTrack restoration
Remember multiple (named?) Preferred views.  (Randy WF5X)
Rotating colors for PHG circles to show overlaps more clearly.  (George N1NAZ)
In Australia, we use the date format as 31/03/2011.  Could you include and option to customise the date? (Adrian VK2BAC)
When using the software on a multiscreen system the dialog boxes are centered between my two monitors. (Sean AJ6B)
Attach Overlay status lines to overlay objects as Status Reports.


Mapping Support:
Support checking revision of tiles when loading, via OpenStreetMap.org's /status URL.
OSM Tile access timestamping, revision checking, intelligent purger, grid (pixel?) cache display
Find a way to mark tiles referenced on Windows Mobile without slowing down map loading (queue references to fetcher thread?).
UI-View/.INF map support (Julian G4ILO)(many others)
Does anyone know if UI-View correctly scales the N/S via the Mercator projection or does it linearly map the point in the vertical?

Single file (per zoom level?) tile cache to avoid open/close overhead on tile loader?  SD faster? - Time Open/Read/Close calls.
Make prefetch queue persistent to allow resuming the queue across Internet access issues.  (Daniel KB3MUN)
Make a better directory selector for placing (and creating, possibly moving) map tile sets on Windows Mobile (Greg KO5TH)

Lightning bolts from station to station that was recently involved in an RF exchange (possibly even red->green coloring to indicate direction), Only on reasonable zooms and probably only Win32.  You'd be able to visualize the Digis and IGates and possibly their interactions in near realtime.
Pulse a station icon when a new packet was received.  Only on reasonable zooms and probably only Win32.
Interpret severe weather packets and shade map w/transparency (Fred N7FWM).  (Bradley KC9GQR)
Detect a Mic-E status of Emergency and internally queue a message from that station including callsign, Mic-E status, and current beacon text (Fred N7FWM)
http://www.aprs.net.au/category/national-categories/emergency (James VE6SRV)
New/Local/All popup display similar to D710 when packets are received
Implement a compass direction/distance screen for homing in on GeoCaches or Stations / Objects
You already have the ability to click on an object and the program will tell you how far away it is, and in what direction.  Could you also include a computation for how long it would take to get to the object from where you are?  This would be strictly in a vector sense (no expectation of following roads on the map - I know that's not possible), based on your current velocity and direction.  A graphic of the direction instead of the 16-point compass rose designation would also be good.  ("10 minutes, THAT way.") (Greg KO6TH)
The final feature would be to chain a set of objects in a row, as a rudimentary path from, say, aid station 1, to aid station 2, to aid station 3, and so forth.  The time to an object would be computed from the sum of each segment between where you are and the object of interest and your current headway to the first one.  I know this borders on functionality in a modern GPS, but the key difference is that the objects (waypoints in GPS-speak) can be either ones you set, or ones that others set via APRS.  As tactical things change in the APRS space, your target and path can change in real time to follow.  So now if I need to pick up something from Sam, and then Sally, I can enter their SSIDs into a chain and find them even if they move, stopping off at the canteen (private object) on the way back. (Greg KO6TH)
DX support - detect over time (10min pktlog for RF?), put out status or capabilities or DX packet
Capture DX packets on a "DX LIST"
Review TinyWebPages spec for "DX LIST" presentation
Support "DX List" like bulletins, but not recorded. - See Resource.txt
Research actual DX spot format in DX clusters. What is in Resource.txt?
UI-Traffic support - Needs graphs for local view, but can it do an object?  callsign-TF?  -RT?  Configurable?
Put RF traffic counts into Telemetry
Possibly add per-port proportional pathing for beacons / status / objects?
Support PHG calculator and include range in Compressed packet if no CSE/SPD or Altitude and auto-insert into beacons where appropriate
Support FreqSpec configurator for objects and/or my beacons.
Make the Dead-Reckoned station symbol clickable for a Station popup menu
Put dots (stars?) (0-100% = red/green) at cellular switch points.  Show min/max at each point w/old/new and merge multiple changes within a dLat/dLon distance.
Interpret $PKWDPOS and Yaesu equivalent as some sort of station if not "really" heard on APRS.
Show station counts in View / RF menu, especially RemoteRF, -IS Capable and -IS Only
Correct the station hourly digi counts to only credit an early digi once per packet (somehow).
Support radar overlays like xastir does (John kc9kko)
Sync Windows time from GPS when valid and user requests sync.

Parse and display grid-square beacons appropriately (whatever that means)
Add station-type-dependant Query options to Station Popup menu.  (See UI-View supported queries below)
Honor response footprint in ?APRS? query
Filter implementation w/TCP/IP feed and/or Scrolling Stations and/or display -> Named filters!


Messaging Subsystem:
Enhanced message support (Julian G4ILO)
Support remaining message-based queries, Configurable suppression of auto-answers (or display?)
If replying to a displayed message for another -SSID, spoof the source as that -SSID and watch for corresponding acks (Fred N7FMH) - Checkbox for spoof and add self to used path.
Remember and provide for re-display of received messages.
If target station's platform is known, format message sending screen accordingly.
Support more ?APRSx queries
Select specific RF Interfaces for message transmission
Thumbnail map (zoomable, of course) of user's current location in QSO window
Auto-adjust filter for MessageGroups, or suppress message-only stations from CloseStation list and Stations scroller?
Support Messages / Recent Messages to show list of recently read messages for quick recall
Send Message on RF to only those channels that heard the station
Send Ack to -IS only if a message from an unknown station was received from there (EMAIL-2 responses)
Add [n/m] to wrapped messages or possibly trailing + to allow for remote re-assembly (especially APRSISCE's Chat)
Fix length of ?APRSS query response to avoid wrapping as a long message
Enable/Disable message group message capture and/or display
-IS to RF IGated messages should be transmitted on the heard station's Alternate Network ID (if specified), not APRSISCE/32's.
Better reflect current transmission/ack/retry status in the chat windows (12/23/2010 6:15am) (Julian G4ILO)
Add ability to cancel one or all non-acked messages directly from the chat windows (Julian G4ILO)

User-specified alternate (reduced) transmitted message length for RF-involved stations. - Possibly automatically shrinking over RF-pathed stations between acks based on retry count.
Buffer long (non-split) chat messages as single line to allow for changing length before transmission if path changes or degrades.
If sending a non-acked message via APRS-IS to a station that appears to be RF-linked, queue a secondary copy 31 seconds delayed.
Dupe detector needs to clear out redundantly received, non-acked (or ack'd as well, but send a new ack) messages so remote queries / commands don't get multi-processed.

Document <MessageGroup> use for Australian (and maybe US) weather alert messages. - Make them online configurable. (Adrian VK2BAC)
Color callsign menus in Monitor chat window to match text (Colin 2E0XSD)
I am putting together a mobile laptop running Aprsisce/32 for a friend. He mentioned how hard, and dangerous it is to send APRS messages while driving. Texting and driving not good. So I thought, how about some "Quik keys or Macros". Press say F1 for a pre-set message. It would then enter the text into the message box. Seems easy enough. Is this something that could be worked into the program? (Kevin W7BOZ)

Track duplicate objects and suppress older "overrides" from display unless explicitly selected via a new Screen / "Obsolete Objects" which are still displayed at 50% of aged brightness w/line to actual current location.  Also line to owner if known.
View / Objects option that only shows objects, not "real" stations w/line to owning station (which are shown).
Add automatic o/*/ filter to active object names to be sure to receive other definitions to auto-disable.
Show multi-object info in Station popup.
Name current (not me) owner in Object menu and dialog (title?)
Put objects into APRSISOB.XML configuration file separate from APRSISCE/32.XML for sharability?

About box hangs connecting to version server if IP address changes from cellular to WiFi (DNS resolution issue?) (KJ4ERJ-12)
Validate path entry for AX.25-valid pieces/parts
Warn on non-AX.25 -SSID in callsign
If the program finds itself unable to write to the current directory...I can't even tell it's doing strange things, so I can't fix it (YET) (Joe N1MNU)
Support <View.VisibleLabelsMax> in configuration dialog somewhere


Metric units (Julian G4ILO)
Make Local Hops, Recent Minutes, and Duplicate Seconds configuration options

Link-specific status text and paths (Phillip ZL2TZE) & Proportional Pathing (Fred N7FMH) - Inherit
Warn or disallow multi-selection of a single COM port for multiple I/Fs (Colin M6XSD)
Configuration of receive-only, staggered transmission, and/or beacons vs IGate per port
-IS to RF gate functionality to a) gate none, b) gate all messages to stations "recently" "heard" locally, (as it does today) or c) gate only Acks to stations from whom a message was recently received (and said ack not heard via RF yet after a short random delay?).

G6UIM - 9/13/2010 5:56pm
Hi all

Have been chatting with our glorious leader (that’s Lynn) about a satellite mode. I will see if I can remember 
all that was said in email and over APRS and put down here for thoughts and comments.

I have been trying to get a contact via the ISS using APRSIS32 and at the moment I have to shut off the IS 
feed to get a message to go via RF. Not ideal as I would like to gate received messages over IS for others.

So with this in mind I came up with the following thoughts

Sat Mode:
Summary:
Gate all But not your own messages
Possible option to allow a buddy to use your station to attempt a Sat contact.
use hearing your own message back from the Sat as an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you don’t tie up the Sat and give others a chance.
Show RF vs IS messages in Chat, Colorization?  Text?  Symbol <>?
Configurable default to NoAck chats (for satellite instances)


Details... 

Only thought about using one RF port so thoughts on having a Sat specific port in a multiport setup would be good.

Force the message over an RF port and not via IS. So the station you are trying to contact will receive the 
message hopefully via Satellite and not via IS from you.

Gate received messages from the RF port to IS so you are a help to others as an RX SGATE. 

Do not gate messages received on IS to RF as flooding the Sat with messages is not helpful. 

A reasonable retry rate as getting into the Sat can be hard, it will hear lots of stations that you won’t so 
TX collisions are inevitable, and you have a limited time. use hearing your own message back from the Sat as 
an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you don’t tie up the Sat and give others a chance.

Also either ignore messages over IS or highlight they came from either IS or RF so you can see you made a 
contact over the Sat.

Am sure I have forgotten to add a few things above. And have stated the obvious a bit in places.

Thoughts on the above would be good.

Who is sure Lynn is going to hard code a ban on his callsign sometime soon

 You could take that further why use radio at all, I have the internet on my phone, and a phone on my err phone. 
And people do ask why I bother with “CB”

Well maybe not a special port.

I agree on the manual send and abort, the ability to keep clicking send until you get a reply then kill the 
message would be good (with ack turned off).

Although the auto retry and except digi as an ack would be good in some instances, or at least a warning a digi 
was received.

At the moment I use 2 instances of aprsis one with IS turned off that I use to transmit and the other with IS 
turned on to see if anyone has received me.

I could do it with one, with what I was suggesting and also be able to gate received stations to IS.

Steve
G6UIM 


G4ILO - 9/14/2010 4:16am
It's another example of the absurdity of our hobby. Why would you want to send a message to someone by bouncing 
it off a satellite when you are both connected to the internet anyway?  :)  Just to see if it is possible. Which 
is why I would agree with Steve that it would be useful to have an option to prevent beacons and messages 
originated by you from being sent to -IS whilst still allowing messages received over RF to be gated.

I'm not sure what the purpose of a special satellite port would be. When I operate through the ISS I'm using my 
normal 2m setup tuned to the satellite frequency. I run a separate copy of APRSISCE/32 with its own XML file 
containing the satellite beacon text, path with RS0ISS-4, increased beacon frequency etc.

There were a couple of features I would like to see in a "satellite mode" which I kept quiet about because I 
figured they were not really a top priority. Now I'm not sure if I could remember them all.

I would prefer messaging in satellite mode to default to "no ack". You don't always remember to untick the ack 
box and you don't really want people trying to ack back through the space station.

Rather than have a message resent automatically at frequent intervals as Steve suggested I would prefer to 
control the sending manually so I can try to pick the right moment to send it. So what I would like is for 
the text of the message not to disappear when it is sent so I can try again without having to retype it.

None of these suggestions make any sense in the context of "normal" APRS so I would understand if it was felt 
that it was not appropriate for APRSISCE to support them.

Julian, G4ILO

G6UIM - 9/14/2010 12:00pm

Hi Lynn,

Had a re think.

I like the idea of the manual send rather than auto. So basically an ack less message box, you type the message 
in and it gets sent when you click send, but the the message still displays on screen and gets sent again when 
you click send. You need to manually remove the box.

Obviously send the message only via RF.

Keep the IS fully functional apart from not gating IS to RF.

My original thought was not receive messages from IS but that’s bad as blocks messages that might get sent from others.

So 3 message receive modes.

Receive all messages however they arrive, for when you don’t mind if the message comes direct from the sat or is 
gated onto IS by another station. Or direct from the other station.

Don’t display messages on IS from the station/s you are trying to send to via the sat. for when you want an RF 
only QSO with the station but still want to receive from others.

Don’t display any message that comes in on IS. (perhaps they could be stored and displayed when out of sat mode)

Have this configurable on a port basis as some people might want to have a radio on the normal APRS freq and 
another running for Satellites. Would need path and beacon on a port by port basis.

More notes from 2010/12/13:

Hi Lynn,

My thoughts, for whatever they're worth...
What I miss is simply a list of stations heard and their status and other data, in reverse order of receipt.  
The three item list in the upper left corner is barely long enough to see something of interest when you're 
watching the screen.  It's useless for this purpose if you turn you attention elsewhere for even a moment.  
My Kenwood TH-D7 has, effectively, both forms.  When a station is heard, it's displayed on the front panel 
and announced with a cheerful beep.  A quick flick of the stick and you can see the details.  Or, you can hit 
the List button and scroll back through time to review the last 40 events.

I suppose your design intent is that if you want to see what's going on around you, you'd just look at the map.  
Whether fed from RF or IS, objects appear on the map as received, and if you click on them, all the data gets 
displayed.  The problem is that events of some (mild) interest often occur off-map, and looking at a map gives 
little to no clue at the age of the data.  Yes, slowly graying out a station helps here, but there's no sequence 
information which could be useful in the field.  While I am annoyed when my D7 cheerfully beeps and informs me 
of a wide-too-many station's beacon dutifully digipeated from hundreds of miles away, I am also informed by 
weather information from the region beyond the bounds of my typical monitoring area.  Periodically zooming the 
map out (polling) to see if anything is there is a less effective than requesting (pulling) a list of the last 
50 or so events. 

For me, the particular call sign is less important as an initial sort; reverse time order (newest first) is better.
Then, I might request a sort by call sign or distance from me.  I think this is also best from a CPU load perspective.

Given the large set of entries from the IS feed, I would probably want to not save station information if they 
were more than some distance from me (configurable, of course).  Information without a position included would 
only be seen in the screen event scroll.  This should keep the list from being flushed through with locally 
irrelevant events too quickly.
Greg  KO6TH

I agree Greg, And adding the ability to apply the current filter (ie distance) and perhaps even a list# limit 
of say 100 stations. This would present me a list of the last 100 stations in the local 50 miles and NOT a 
complete list of Lynn's 17,000.

I think this would be useful and is used on all the Kenwood and Yaesu APRS radios.




12/30/2010 10:59am - Queries from Keih VE7GDH

Looking at the HELP from UI-View...

APRS Queries
UI-View32 supports the following APRS query messages. To send one
of these queries to another station, simply key it in like a normal message.
When receiving a query, UI-View32 responds as follows:-

?APRSP - sends a location beacon.
?APRSS - sends the status text.
?APRSO - sends your active objects.
?APRSD - sends a list of stations that have been heard direct.
?APRST (or ?PING?) - sends the route by which the query was received.
?APRSH <callsign> - sends information on when <callsign> was last heard.
?VER? (not an APRS query, but some APRS software supports it) - sends
             information on the software version in use.

Note that queries and responses are one-off transmissions.
They are not retried and are not acknowledged.

2011/01/16 10:42am [aprsisce] Re: Tiny Web Pages

I would like to do something like this but I have no desire to run UI-View in order to do it. I did have a conversation with Lynn a few days ago about possible ways of doing it. I don't think it would be very easy to implement as a standalone program that connects to APRS-IS. At the least I think you would need a managed interface with APRSISCE/32 that would provide the third party add-in with information such as the position of the station wanting to get information and the commands they are sending. At best all the functionality would be in APRSISCE/32 itself and all the user had to do is provide the information.

1/16/2011 - 11:12am Re: [aprsisce] Re: AVRS

Now Lynn, all you need to do on the Kenwood interface is to auto-tune
the other side of the radio automatically when an AVRS request comes
in.

After talking with Bob about AVRS at Dayton waaaay back, I came home
and started playing with my D700 and simulated the AVRS functionality
with a terminal program. I came up with some conceptual settings for
operation.

Full manual: What you have right now, a message pops up telling you a
call is coming in on repeater XXX.
Semi Auto: Message comes in with a TUNE(able) frequency embedded, and
you simply need to hit the TUNE button.
Full Auto: Message comes in, pops up on screen and the other side of
the radio automatically tunes to the frequency.

Oh yeah, this was before the QSY function (inserting the other side
frequency into the position report) or TUNE functions were around
either. Those were functions that I was playing with as well, just had
no way to implement them. (There are a few concepts that I shared with
Bob that I think sparked some ideas...)

APRSISCE/32 could be the first on the block to be able to do the three
AVRS QSY modes.

Lynn can you set some thing up that will tell how far the stations are from me just by moving the mouse over to the station
Also is their a way that an old man with an eye and a half can change the coller of his station in the scroll windo so that I can see it when it beaconds
If you cand no big thing
Thank you

I'm good with that, I was snooping at Bob's TWP page, and he used + as
a bullet for the list, which I suggested as a lead character. It just
needs to be something to indicate that the group would be a TWP object
response.

Yup, you've got the concept... Do we need to add another message
destination, or can we use one of these?

A message such as QST ?NETS might work, but that would end up showing
up on all clients as a received message. The Kenwood radios all
default to capturing these messages and showing them to the user.

If we defined another message group that didn't display on to the
user, but rather just triggered the TWP output, that might be better.

What about a message group called QRU (Have you anything for me?)

QRU ?HOSP (Do you have any information about local hospitals?)

Yes, it is indeed an issue if clients respond to these queries over
the internet feed. You even have contention issues if you just stay on
RF only. Ignore any issues with internet feeds for now. Sending out a
QRU ?GAS query might be received by a number of stations that have the
ability to respond. Do you really want objects spewed out showing gas
stations by a station that is 2 hops away, perhaps 100 miles away?
Maybe while implementing this concept, a distance limit might be
useful. The user could define a maximum distance from the querying
station to send objects. ie. If I hear a query from a local station,
and my max distance is 20 miles, I'll send any objects that are
located within 20 miles of the station sending the query. The object
might be 40 miles from me, but within 20 miles of the querying
station. Conversely, if the station sending the query is 50 miles from
me, and I don't have any objects within 20 miles of the querying
station, I don't send anything.

Also, have the query able to include a distance that the querying
station can send. ie. QRU ?HOSP 50 would send a request for hospitals
within 50 miles. The 50 at the end of the query would over ride the
user's default distance limit, allowing users to look for queried
objects further afield if required.

On the same page. Now, time to ensure that you're not creating
artificial boundaries. Remember that APRS defines the packets that
move around, but not how the programs use those packets. You have run
into that a number of times, where the APRS packet structure is
defined in the APRS 101 document, but what the heck do you do with it?

APRSISCE/32 could be the vehicle to define the generic TWP
implementation. Don't wait for ratification of the implementation of
the concept by the masses. Define it, implement it, and release it to
the world. Perhaps some of the other clients out there may jump on the
bandwagon and implement it, while others that are locked in the past
may not be able to support the concept.

The TWP concept isn't defined in the APRS 101 document, but it uses
conveyances that are defined in the document. I say APRSISCE/32 needs
to lead the way, and define a new way of delivering TWP information in
a smart manner.

Now if we could only do something with that mouthful of a name!

Jeff and I were having a conversation Friday about APRS and telemetry. I have no idea how it works..... but. Since I have my Echolink node up and running I am going to need away to control it remotely. I have heard of people using this for home automation over APRS. Instead of me setting up a whole new radio system I was thinking about using telemetry over APRS to do this. I could send telemetry info, or APRS-DTMF (Needs to be done, see Bobs page) over APRS to do this.
The Feature Request that I have is for Aprsisce to be able to decode this telemetry. And could be used to control signal lines on a LPT port. I know this would probably take a lot of work on your part. Or maybe not. We use to build, (and I still have them) TNC's that ran off the LPT port. Used a simple Bell202 chip (I think, would have to look at it) for the tones used for Packet/APRS. Can't recall the name of it :) Anyway getting off topic. Used a type of KISS mode or HOST software.
Anyway, an addition to Aprsisce to be able to set telemetry definitions to control output on LPT port. Reading the aprsig group posts really got me thinking on this telemetry thing. Please don't kill the idea, but give me some feedback and thoughts. If it is possible for someone to be able to interface with Aprsisce to do this, I can find a programmer so you don't have to deal with it. But I think that Telemetry control over APRS/APRSISCE to do all kinds of stuff would be a HUGE benefit.
If this can not be done, maybe I can find a way for a simple TNC to simultaneously monitor the signal lines. This would be receive only, and would like Bi-Directional in and out confirmation.
So what are your thoughts on this?

30 seconds seems a bit long to me. I would have thought 5 seconds would be enough. If you are going to do that I wounder if it would be an idea to include a random delay before responding, so that if someone sends a request that is heard by two stations that can respond, the responses are less likely to collide with each other?
