Here's what's new in the APRSISCE6P100316.zip and APRSIS321003016.zip

Finally changed the app identifier from APWW00/APWM00 to APWW01/APWM01 (even with base 36, I've only got 1,296 versions available!)

Allow a configured Range of 0.  This eliminates the Me (m/) filter, the auto-range filter on dragged maps, and changes the tracking filter from Friend (f/) to Buddy (b/).  Remember, filters only apply to the -IS feed, not RF.

Support <View.ZoomMin> and <View.ZoomMax> configuration but only via editing the XML file.  (Fred N7FMH)

Added Min/Max station age to the "Close Stations" Popup (double-click the left skinny bars on the right edge of the screen)

Don't switch TRACK() stations when the current one is replaced due to <Stations.MaxCount>.  (It was working on MaxAge, just not MaxCount)  (Gary WB0BZR)

Draw ambiguity circle on Windows Mobile only for tracking (centered) station

Draw a tight purple circle around the station in addition to the larger circle for Ambiguity stations (only if View / Ambiguity OR for ambiguously tracked station)

Don't toggle View / All off automatically when turning On View / Ambiguity.  This adds circles instead of removing stations.  You can always manually toggle View / All off if desired.

Corrected a subtle problem where the wrong message recipient was pre-selected if you select Message from a popup menu or Yes from the Station Popup.  If KJ4ERJ-12 was in the list before KJ4ERJ, then it would be selected in the drop-down even though KJ4ERJ was the intended -SSID.  (AF3K vs AF3K-1)

The scrolling station log now shows the actual station or object ID, not the originator or IGate.  (I hope, someone on RF only, let me know if I got it right this time!)  (Fred N7FMH)

If you've ever sent a message to a station, that station's popup menu and dialog will continue to offer messaging even if the station doesn't identify itself as supporting it.  This is for thos Tracker2/Nuvi combinations and TT4s with attached displays and keyboards that don't use the proper APRS datatype to indicate messaging capable.  KJ4ERJ-9 being one of them!

If an APRS-IS server returnes "unverified" in a # logresp, a warning message is displayed ("Warning: APRS-IS Server Rejected Password (unverified)").  This message is suppressed until the password is changed, but it IS recorded in the XML file for diagnostic traceback (<SuppressUnverified>).  (WB0BZR SP9RTT KJ4QHR)

If saved coordinates for Home are invalid (+/-85 x +/-180) at startup, the user is asked to drag the map to get them set appropriately.  This also is checked on close just like an initial activation.  (KC9GQR)

If <OSM.Path> doesn't seem to exist, the user is prompted to set a new location for the tiles until at least a writable location is found.

If the final two components of a selected location for OSMTiles are redundant, (say ../OSMTiles/OSMTiles/), the redundancy is eliminated before probing for usability.  (Colin M6XSD) (Dave N8PU)

If the user cancels setting an OSMTiles location, ask if they'd like to disable the OSMFetcher or try again.

When OSM Tile Fetching is enabled, double-check validity of the <OSM.Path> directory or allow re-setting.

Rework scrolling station list colorization so that the distance color is based on the packet location, not the current location.  Also made painting more efficient.

Parse !SN! from comment and put SkyWarn into station popup.  Also support View / SkyWarn filter to see only SkyWarn stations.

Put 2 character "Traditional" table/symbol in Symbol configuration dialog and don't allow an overlay of / or \ that are actually primary and secondary table identifiers (spin button now skips them).  (Gerard VK2JNG)

The configuration dialog now allows you to change to a blank filter.  Also, do NOT put the word "filter" in there.  APRSISCE/32 builds the actual filter string.  Thanks to SQ9MLI for finding this bug!

Detect configuration change in CallSign or Password and disconnect APRS-IS if connected.  This will bring the new callsign and password into effect without a restart.  This also corrects "pirated acks" as the client was still acking by the old callsign, not the new one.

Detect configuration change in filter and retransmit filter ONLY if changed.  The client used to retransmit the filter on ANY configuration change.

New <MinForceTime> that governs how frequently Transmit will actually force a beacon without an extra confirmation of intent.

Transmit now overrides the <Genius.MinTime> setting and generates a beacon early.

If you had a View / RF / All active and an RF station goes idle for too long, it won't disappear until something else triggers a circle repaint.  This has been fixed.  (KJ4ERJ-1)

Due to vertical space considerations, Cap: (capabilities) no longer display on station popup





To Dos:  (Still Incomplete and getting LONGER instead of SHORTER!)

-IS to RF gate functionality to a) gate none (as it does today), b) gate all messages to stations "recently" "heard" locally, or c) gate only Acks to stations from whom a message was recently received (and said ack not heard via RF yet after a short random delay?).  C would accomplish a PSK-63 initiated QSO without risking flooding the channel with stuff that doesn't need to be there.
