Here's what's new in the APRSISCE6P110211.zip and APRSIS32110211.zip

About version is 2011/02/11 07:14

Support Luminoscity in Weather data (AB9FX)

Support Water Height in Weather data (http://www.aprs.org/aprs11/spec-wx.txt)

Put "Time: FIXED (111111z)" for permanent objects in Station info popup

Fix ?ARPSH <station> to include traffic counts if heard on RF

Record time and reason of last save into XML config file (attempting to identify unnecessarily frequent saves).

Correct spelling of Luminosity (it's not Luminoscity...)

Add Configure / Screen / DateTime / Date Only, Time Only, Default, and Custom to specify the date vs time based on the units of the seconds.

Delay longer on saving the configuration file when bulletins and telemetry definitions are received.  (I'm tired of watching my phone sync with my desktop when I'm not using it!)

Wrap text to multiple CQs for ANSRVR group announcements (Julian G4ILO)

Wrap text to multiple EMAIL-2 messages if it is too long

Ensure that a leading % gets cloned onto subsequently wrapped lines for Kenwood voice-message triggering.  (This has been there for some time, but the implementation was extended to cover the previous two changes).

Corrected an insidious bug that would cause the effective filter to drop all of the automatic components (like the NWS offices) and revert to just the m/range and Add Filter components.  This explains disappearing MultiTrack objects as well as dropped weather alerts if the APRS-IS connection was dropped and automatically recovered.  Panning the main window (assuming a non-zero Range) would re-establish the full automatic filter.  This is now fixed.  (Steve KF6WAX)

Support Shapefiles (Win32 only).  Only as an outline currently, but it's better than nothing!  Each NWS alert is expanded into multiple objects, one per county/zone.  You have to Configure / NWS Shapes / Add File... to tell it where the *.dbf/*.shp file(s) are located.  See WA8LMF's writeup at http://wa8lmf.net/aprs/get_nws_shapefiles.htm.  Just substitute APRSISCE/32 and Configure / NWS Shapes / Add File... where appropriate.

Configure a bunch of default line types and symbols for the various NWS Product Codes (http://www.aprs-is.net/WX/ProdCodes.aspx), Eventually these may be user-configurable, but currently are hard-coded.

Do the same for the WXSVR-AU server product codes (http://wxsvr.aprs.net.au/products.php)

Expire NWS objects at their specified expiration time (See NWS-Expires trace log...)

Support Screen / Labels / NWS Calls to hide the pretty useless NWS object callsigns from cluttering the map

Fixed a moving antenna (KB2OCJ-R) caused by a bad course/speed vs PHGnnnn/freq in the parser (Mark KC2VYI)
KB2OCJ-R>APRS,TCPIP*,qAC,T2OREGON:=4048.00N/07414.38WrPHG9490/927.0625 -25MHz PL141.3

Support transparent fills on shapefile and MultiLine areas.  See Configure / NWS Shapes / Opacity.  0 is no fill, 100 = full coverage (disappearing maps).  5-10 seems ok to my eyes.

Made a fix for the lower color depths.  It works on my Remote Desktop Connection, but it might impact performance.  If any of you notice that this version is slower than before (with no NWS shapes showing), please let me know.

Optimized and remembered the shapefile to point conversion so that only the first time drawing in a new zoom or pan takes time.  Dropped my CPU from 40+% to 8-10% watching Australia lit up.

Support Configure / Screen / Label / Max Visible... to set the limit on screen labels without editing the XML file.

Define APDUxx as U2APRS for Android (http://aobajoke.no-ip.org/~ja7ude/japanese/u2aprs10/indexe.html)

Mark NWS objects Killed rather than simply purging them away on expiration.

Correct bust that allowed followed killed objects to disappear rather substantially fade until they're no longer needed.

Shaped areas that are killed but centered in a MultiTrack will turn light gray until they're not centered anymore.  If you look at the station info popup, it will say "KILLED OBJECT".

NWS shapes are now included in Station popup menu

Corrected black on black station in scrolling station logs when NWS alerts are processed.  (Recursion is such an ugly word, especially when it's unexpected)

If too many MultiTracks are open when an NWS alert is received and Configure / NWS / Popup MultiTrack is checked, it just quietly ignores the problem.  It used to complain for every one generating LOTS of message boxes overnight.

When manually panning a window, remove the multiline objects to (dramatically) improve pan responsiveness.  Area fills will re-appear when the pan operation is complete (ie. when you release the mouse button).

Fixed Configure / Ports / APRS-IS to actually use the Enable, QuietTime, Callsign and Comment (even though the latter two are non-changeable)

Change station info popup relative distance/bearing to FromCtr and FromME instead of opposite (Julian G4ILO)

Add outline to the shapes so that I can see if some of them are actually TOO transparent.  Please let me know the object ID if you see one like that, particularly Australia's Flood areas.

Configure / NWS Shapes / ShowMe will popup individual shapes that include, or are near, the screen center of the main window when the menu option is selected.

Replace Track(ObjectID) with the description of the shape for test shapes and better describe shape-expanded NWS objects.

Title of windows "following" an NWS object (like the tests and auto-popups from Configure / NWS / Popup MultiTrack) are more informative.

Configure / NWS Shapes now supports unchecking individual files.  I need to add a prompt to ask if you're only disabling or would like to remove the file from the list.

Whenever a version change is detected, the pre-upgraded XML files is saved as .XML.yyyymmddhhmm where yyyymmddhhmm is the previous version string that should match a saved .EXE.yyyymmddhhmm.

If the program detects a version downgrade, it will warn you that some settings may be lost.  This is due to the non-downgrade-compatible XML configuration upgrades that may have occurred.  Proceed at your own risk.

Corrected bust in shape optimizer that was causing not all of the "rings" to draw.  This was particularly evident in QLC111.  You should see lots more detail in AUS shapes now.

Don't pop up an already-expired NWS object.  WXSVR-AU does LOTS of these for some reason.  I'm not sure how long they keep transmitting the NWS-CANCLs.

Force a filter of m/0 if no other filter is required (Julian G4ILO) (Adam KB8VOM)

Configure / NWS / Popup MultiTrack now has Always and New options.  "Always" will create or focus MultiTracks for NWS objects.  "New" will only do this for a newly created object.

Support suppressing NWS Popups unless they describe an Area (multiline or shapefile).  This avoids consuming a bunch of redundant MultiTracks for single point objects.

New (possibly temporary) Packets(Internal) trace log as well as INT (vs RF or IS) flagging in both the Transmit and Packets logs.  This will make identification of internally-generated packets a bit easier, in case I ever need to know such a distinction.

Transmit when "T" is pressed on the keyboard (assuming the main map window is focused, otherwise Windows won't tell me you even hit a key).  (Alan N6VUD)

New Configure / NWS / Notify Products to individually disable the various known NWS Products (http://www.aprs-is.net/WX/ProdCodes.aspx and http://wxsvr.aprs.net.au/products.php) from triggering message notifications and MultiTrack popups.  Eventually you'll be able to configure more stuff on each Product than just the enable like color, line style, symbol, -IS to RF IGate...

Configure / NWS / Popup MultiTrack / Close On Expire if selected will auto-close a MultiTrack window if the contained object is NONE displayed, centered, and an expired NWS object.

If multiple areas are specified in a single NWS message, they are now coalesced into a single object.  This works well for US objects, but the AUS alerts are coming from different offices, so they still don't get much smaller.

Configure / NWS / NWS Entry Servers will now let you disable NWS recognition by entry server.  It knows about AE5PL-WX (USA) and WXSVR-AU (Australia) as defaults but will learn others if anyone else begins injecting NWS objects.

Fixed the Configure / NWS / Notify Products so that they actually show whether they are disabled or not.  It was working before, just not making the symbol disappear.

Corrected behavior if a shapefile cannot be opened.  APRSISCE/32 should no longer exit in this situation.

Shape/DBF files are now probed and will be disabled if they are not both accessible and seem to be what their name implies. (James VE6SRV)

Weather objects that came from an NWS Entry Server that has a configured finger server (AE5PL-WX only right now) will offer a "Finger" option on the popup menu.  Selecting this will attempt to retrieve and display the full text of the NWS alert.  This option is disabled if Enables / Internet Access is not checked.  (Steve KF6WAX)

When you disable a configured shapefile, you are given the option of removing the file from the list.  If you say No, it will simply be disabled and remain unused.  (Note: This was backwards in the previous release and didn't get mentioned)

Click on a colored shape to find the station causing the color. (Steve KF6WAX) - This was actually in an earlier release, but I neglected to credit Steve.

Changing Opacity and enabling/disabling shapes was only forcing a refresh on the main window.  It now refreshes all MultiTracks as well.

Removed empty MultiLine definition preventing popup of things like:
CTLBFU>APRS,qAS,WXSVR-AU:;CTL0437zA*040437z3341.85S/15024.67E:R NSW, Govett St Katoomba  {24bAA

Fixed WinMo's NWS Offices popup menu population

Checkmark MultiTrack on a station popup menu if it is already tracking somewhere

Don't offer Range on a station popup menu in the main window.  APRSISCE/32 automatically ranges the main window.

Fixed Configure / Screen / Lat/Lon to properly display Configure / Beacon / Precision ambiguity coordinates for screen center.

Add Configure / NWS / Notify LineType to show descriptions of the various line types and how many NWS Products are of a specified type (http://www.aprs-is.net/WX/MultilineProtocol.aspx).  More to come here later...

Added a missing length check on a [512] byte buffer in the KISS logic.  Not tha there's a high likelyhood of actually decoding such a long packet, but we're trying to figure out why Colin, 2E0XSD is terminating intermittently.

Configure / NWS Notify LineType now offers to set or clear the enables on the corresponding Products.  This is what I was hoping to do with it.  Someday, it'll allow configuring the rendering details, just like the Products will someday support configuring the associated line type.  (BTW, if you're brave and careful, you can do this now via the XML file.  Just be warned that you can mess things up in there too!)

Configure / Beacon / After Transmit disables beaconing until after the current location is verified and Transmit is pressed.  The current location is automatically centered and zoomed to make it easy.  This is ignored if the GPS is enabled at or after startup.

Fixed the initial startup "Drag and Zoom to Home, then Click Transmit" reminder to remain in the bottom center of the map even if the window is re-sized.  This also applies to the new "Beaconing Suspended" reminder window (they're actually the same window!).

Configure / Objects / <YourObject> dialog now supports "GoTo" which will move the main window to center on the object's location and zooms to the minimum level to set the location.  Note that the object will only be visible at that location if it is enabled!  This feature can be used to select from a "list" of location (objects) for the purpose of setting a current location for the new Configure / Beacon / After Transmit feature.

Support FTM350v1.3(RO) port type.  This is receive-only and completely untested with a "real" FTM-350 connection, but at least it interprets the captures I've received from various people!

Support IS-Sever port type providing a feed-through APRS-IS with local filters (for multiple instances of Win32 version with a single full feed to APRS-IS).  None of the port configuration dialog checkboxes applly (except enable).  A custom dialog for this port type will come in the future.  But for now, configure it as an IP port, 0.0.0.0 is the node (or bind it directly to one of your interface IPs like 127.0.0.1 for local access only), the Port is up to you but must be unique and available on your local machine.  When an APRS-IS client connects, the user logon string is required and validate.  If the password doesn't match, input from that port will not even display on the server's instance let alone get forwarded on to APRS-IS.  A valid password port will go out to all other local connections, be displayed on the server instance, and be forwarded on to the upstream APRS-IS network server.  This is supported on WinMo as well, but I have only tested it on Win32.  As the question was raised, "who would turn their phone into a server?"  I suspect the answer is balloon chasers that want to distribute an APRS-IS feed across a local, mobile WiFi network!

Some weather data files apparently only put a single digit day in at the beginning of the month.  All previous samples had a leading zero to make a fixed, parseable field.  Updated to support a single digit Date.  ()

Add ,qAR,call-SSID to RF-received packets before gating them from RF to IS.  This is the first phase of q-Construct () support.

Fixed a few issues related to the IS-Server support including at least passing messages addressed to the immediately connected downstream client callsign.

Downstream transmitted packets no longer flag as * (RF Received, but no new qAR) in the upstream server's scrolling station pane.

You can now send messages to your own callsign-SSID like ?APRSS and ?APRSH/L/D.  Just ignore the fact that you see it twice in the chat.  Remember, you're seeing BOTH sides of the conversation, just like you do inside your head when you argue with yourself!

Change the default number of inbound connections to an IS-Server port to 16 (Win32) or 6 (WinMo) (Curt WE7U)

Make sure same-named Station Weather data is displayed on the Me popup dialog (N4MAK)

Fixed NWS Alert explosion to happen regardless of whether or not Messages is checked.  The only way to prevent expansion is to disable the Entry server or NWS Office.   A non-configured Office/CWA is implicitly disabled.  An unknown Entry Server is implicitly Enabled. (Lynn KJ4ERJ)

Fixed Configure / Ports / APRSIS Enable checkbox to actually affect the enable/disable status of the port.  Also, changing the APRS-IS server should trigger a disable/enable sequence to bring the new server into use.

Don't Expire NWS objects based on their received age vs station age, but honor their internal Expiration time.

....




New XML configuration file elements:
<LastSaved> and <LastSaveWhy> to track why config is being saved so seemingly often

<View.NWS.Labels>
<NWS.MultiTrackNew> - Only popup multitrack for NEW NWS objects
<NWS.MultiTrackLines> - Only popup multitrack for non-simple (area) objects
<NWS.MultiTrackAutoClose> - Close MultiTrack when NWS object expires
<NWSServer.*> - Tracks NWS Entry servers

Performance enhancements including:
Delay longer on saving the configuration file when bulletins and telemetry definitions are received.
Optimized shapefile coordinate mapping to screen points for current display
Merge multiple area objects into a single "station" for NWS alerts.

"Highlight Path" from a configurable list of "Interesting" paths (WIDE7-7) (Fred N7FWM)
Make APRSIS32 work under Wine (David WE1U) (Chris KJ4HPQ) (Josh W4SGC) - Still working on Transparency
Display and set "Destination Waypoints" (http://wa8lmf.net/bruninga/APRS-docs/MOBILE.TXT)
Lightning bolts from station to station that was recently involved in an RF exchange (possibly even red->green coloring to indicate direction), Only on reasonable zooms and probably only Win32.  You'd be able to visualize the Digis and IGates and possibly their interactions in near realtime.
Pulse a station icon when a new packet was received.  Only on reasonable zooms and probably only Win32.
Interpret severe weather packets and shade map w/transparency (Fred N7FWM).  (Bradley KC9GQR)
Detect a Mic-E status of Emergency and internally queue a message from that station including callsign, Mic-E status, and current beacon text (Fred N7FWM)
New/Local/All popup display similar to D710 when packets are received
Implement a compass direction/distance screen for homing in on GeoCaches or Stations / Objects
You already have the ability to click on an object and the program will tell you how far away it is, and in what direction.  Could you also include a computation for how long it would take to get to the object from where you are?  This would be strictly in a vector sense (no expectation of following roads on the map - I know that's not possible), based on your current velocity and direction.  A graphic of the direction instead of the 16-point compass rose designation would also be good.  ("10 minutes, THAT way.") (Greg KO6TH)
The final feature would be to chain a set of objects in a row, as a rudimentary path from, say, aid station 1, to aid station 2, to aid station 3, and so forth.  The time to an object would be computed from the sum of each segment between where you are and the object of interest and your current headway to the first one.  I know this borders on functionality in a modern GPS, but the key difference is that the objects (waypoints in GPS-speak) can be either ones you set, or ones that others set via APRS.  As tactical things change in the APRS space, your target and path can change in real time to follow.  So now if I need to pick up something from Sam, and then Sally, I can enter their SSIDs into a chain and find them even if they move, stopping off at the canteen (private object) on the way back. (Greg KO6TH)
DX support - detect over time (10min pktlog for RF?), put out status or capabilities or DX packet

Review TinyWebPages spec for "DX LIST" presentation
Support "DX List" like bulletins, but not recorded. - See Resource.txt
Research actual DX spot format in DX clusters. What is in Resource.txt?

Put RF traffic counts into Telemetry
Possibly add per-port proportional pathing for beacons / status / objects?
Support PHG calculator and include range in Compressed packet if no CSE/SPD or Altitude and auto-insert into beacons where appropriate
Support FreqSpec configurator for objects and/or my beacons.
Make the Dead-Reckoned station symbol clickable for a Station popup menu
Put dots (stars?) (0-100% = red/green) at cellular switch points.  Show min/max at each point w/old/new and merge multiple changes within a dLat/dLon distance.
Interpret $PKWDPOS and Yaesu equivalent as some sort of station if not "really" heard on APRS.
Show station counts in View / RF menu, especially RemoteRF, -IS Capable and -IS Only
Correct the station hourly digi counts to only credit an early digi once per packet (somehow).
Support radar overlays like xastir does (John kc9kko)

Messaging Subsystem:
Enhanced message support (Julian G4ILO)
Support remaining message-based queries, Configurable suppression of auto-answers (or display?)
If replying to a displayed message for another -SSID, spoof the source as that -SSID and watch for corresponding acks (Fred N7FMH) - Checkbox for spoof and add self to used path.
Remember and provide for re-display of received messages.
If target station's platform is known, format message sending screen accordingly.
Support more ?APRSx queries
Select specific RF Interfaces for message transmission
Thumbnail map (zoomable, of course) of user's current location in QSO window

Support Messages / Recent Messages to show list of recently read messages for quick recall
Send Message on RF to only those channels that heard the station
Send Ack to -IS only if a message from an unknown station was received from there (EMAIL-2 responses)
Add [n/m] to wrapped messages or possibly trailing + to allow for remote re-assembly (especially APRSISCE's Chat)
Fix length of ?APRSS query response to avoid wrapping as a long message
Enable/Disable message group message capture and/or display
-IS to RF IGated messages should be transmitted on the heard station's Alternate Network ID (if specified), not APRSISCE/32's.
Better reflect current transmission/ack/retry status in the chat windows (12/23/2010 6:15am) (Julian G4ILO)
Add ability to cancel one or all non-acked messages directly from the chat windows (Julian G4ILO)
Remember message window width (if wider than the font requires) (Julian G4ILO)
Support specification of RF path on Chat windows (Alan 1/3/2011 12:08am)
Schedule (and cancel) redundant acks 30 seconds out (Bob WB4APR)
Msg Table w/from/to/text/time/ack & Retries w/direct retry and delete capability -> Only messages (other msgs "received"?)
Send Message / Chat -> Allow path override if RF-Only selected (Jerry N7YGE)
User-specified alternate (reduced) transmitted message length for RF-involved stations. - Possibly automatically shrinking over RF-pathed stations between acks based on retry count.
Buffer long (non-split) chat messages as single line to allow for changing length before transmission if path changes or degrades.
If sending a non-acked message via APRS-IS to a station that appears to be RF-linked, queue a secondary copy 31 seconds delayed.
Dupe detector needs to clear out redundantly received, non-acked (or ack'd as well, but send a new ack) messages so remote queries / commands don't get multi-processed.

G6UIM - 9/13/2010 5:56pm
Hi all

Have been chatting with our glorious leader (that’s Lynn) about a satellite mode. I will see if I can remember 
all that was said in email and over APRS and put down here for thoughts and comments.

I have been trying to get a contact via the ISS using APRSIS32 and at the moment I have to shut off the IS 
feed to get a message to go via RF. Not ideal as I would like to gate received messages over IS for others.

So with this in mind I came up with the following thoughts

Sat Mode:
Summary:
Gate all But not your own messages
Possible option to allow a buddy to use your station to attempt a Sat contact.
use hearing your own message back from the Sat as an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you don’t tie up the Sat and give others a chance.
Show RF vs IS messages in Chat, Colorization?  Text?  Symbol <>?
Configurable default to NoAck chats (for satellite instances)


Details... 

Only thought about using one RF port so thoughts on having a Sat specific port in a multiport setup would be good.

Force the message over an RF port and not via IS. So the station you are trying to contact will receive the 
message hopefully via Satellite and not via IS from you.

Gate received messages from the RF port to IS so you are a help to others as an RX SGATE. 

Do not gate messages received on IS to RF as flooding the Sat with messages is not helpful. 

A reasonable retry rate as getting into the Sat can be hard, it will hear lots of stations that you won’t so 
TX collisions are inevitable, and you have a limited time. use hearing your own message back from the Sat as 
an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you don’t tie up the Sat and give others a chance.

Also either ignore messages over IS or highlight they came from either IS or RF so you can see you made a 
contact over the Sat.

Am sure I have forgotten to add a few things above. And have stated the obvious a bit in places.

Thoughts on the above would be good.

Who is sure Lynn is going to hard code a ban on his callsign sometime soon

9/14/2010 6:13am

 You could take that further why use radio at all, I have the internet on my phone, and a phone on my err phone. 
And people do ask why I bother with “CB”

Well maybe not a special port.

I agree on the manual send and abort, the ability to keep clicking send until you get a reply then kill the 
message would be good (with ack turned off).

Although the auto retry and except digi as an ack would be good in some instances, or at least a warning a digi 
was received.

At the moment I use 2 instances of aprsis one with IS turned off that I use to transmit and the other with IS 
turned on to see if anyone has received me.

I could do it with one, with what I was suggesting and also be able to gate received stations to IS.

Steve
G6UIM 


G4ILO - 9/14/2010 4:16am
It's another example of the absurdity of our hobby. Why would you want to send a message to someone by bouncing 
it off a satellite when you are both connected to the internet anyway?  :)  Just to see if it is possible. Which 
is why I would agree with Steve that it would be useful to have an option to prevent beacons and messages 
originated by you from being sent to -IS whilst still allowing messages received over RF to be gated.

I'm not sure what the purpose of a special satellite port would be. When I operate through the ISS I'm using my 
normal 2m setup tuned to the satellite frequency. I run a separate copy of APRSISCE/32 with its own XML file 
containing the satellite beacon text, path with RS0ISS-4, increased beacon frequency etc.

There were a couple of features I would like to see in a "satellite mode" which I kept quiet about because I 
figured they were not really a top priority. Now I'm not sure if I could remember them all.

I would prefer messaging in satellite mode to default to "no ack". You don't always remember to untick the ack 
box and you don't really want people trying to ack back through the space station.

Rather than have a message resent automatically at frequent intervals as Steve suggested I would prefer to 
control the sending manually so I can try to pick the right moment to send it. So what I would like is for 
the text of the message not to disappear when it is sent so I can try again without having to retype it.

None of these suggestions make any sense in the context of "normal" APRS so I would understand if it was felt 
that it was not appropriate for APRSISCE to support them.

Julian, G4ILO

G6UIM - 9/14/2010 12:00pm

Hi Lynn,

Had a re think.

I like the idea of the manual send rather than auto. So basically an ack less message box, you type the message 
in and it gets sent when you click send, but the the message still displays on screen and gets sent again when 
you click send. You need to manually remove the box.

Obviously send the message only via RF.

Keep the IS fully functional apart from not gating IS to RF.

My original thought was not receive messages from IS but that’s bad as blocks messages that might get sent from others.

So 3 message receive modes.

Receive all messages however they arrive, for when you don’t mind if the message comes direct from the sat or is 
gated onto IS by another station. Or direct from the other station.

Don’t display messages on IS from the station/s you are trying to send to via the sat. for when you want an RF 
only QSO with the station but still want to receive from others.

Don’t display any message that comes in on IS. (perhaps they could be stored and displayed when out of sat mode)

Have this configurable on a port basis as some people might want to have a radio on the normal APRS freq and 
another running for Satellites. Would need path and beacon on a port by port basis.

More notes from 2010/12/13:

Hi Lynn,

My thoughts, for whatever they're worth...
What I miss is simply a list of stations heard and their status and other data, in reverse order of receipt.  
The three item list in the upper left corner is barely long enough to see something of interest when you're 
watching the screen.  It's useless for this purpose if you turn you attention elsewhere for even a moment.  
My Kenwood TH-D7 has, effectively, both forms.  When a station is heard, it's displayed on the front panel 
and announced with a cheerful beep.  A quick flick of the stick and you can see the details.  Or, you can hit 
the List button and scroll back through time to review the last 40 events.

I suppose your design intent is that if you want to see what's going on around you, you'd just look at the map.  
Whether fed from RF or IS, objects appear on the map as received, and if you click on them, all the data gets 
displayed.  The problem is that events of some (mild) interest often occur off-map, and looking at a map gives 
little to no clue at the age of the data.  Yes, slowly graying out a station helps here, but there's no sequence 
information which could be useful in the field.  While I am annoyed when my D7 cheerfully beeps and informs me 
of a wide-too-many station's beacon dutifully digipeated from hundreds of miles away, I am also informed by 
weather information from the region beyond the bounds of my typical monitoring area.  Periodically zooming the 
map out (polling) to see if anything is there is a less effective than requesting (pulling) a list of the last 
50 or so events. 

For me, the particular call sign is less important as an initial sort; reverse time order (newest first) is better.
Then, I might request a sort by call sign or distance from me.  I think this is also best from a CPU load perspective.

Given the large set of entries from the IS feed, I would probably want to not save station information if they 
were more than some distance from me (configurable, of course).  Information without a position included would 
only be seen in the screen event scroll.  This should keep the list from being flushed through with locally 
irrelevant events too quickly.
Greg  KO6TH

I agree Greg, And adding the ability to apply the current filter (ie distance) and perhaps even a list# limit 
of say 100 stations. This would present me a list of the last 100 stations in the local 50 miles and NOT a 
complete list of Lynn's 17,000.

I think this would be useful and is used on all the Kenwood and Yaesu APRS radios.




12/30/2010 10:59am - Queries from Keih VE7GDH

Looking at the HELP from UI-View...

APRS Queries
UI-View32 supports the following APRS query messages. To send one
of these queries to another station, simply key it in like a normal message.
When receiving a query, UI-View32 responds as follows:-

?APRSP - sends a location beacon.
?APRSS - sends the status text.
?APRSO - sends your active objects.
?APRSD - sends a list of stations that have been heard direct.
?APRST (or ?PING?) - sends the route by which the query was received.
?APRSH <callsign> - sends information on when <callsign> was last heard.
?VER? (not an APRS query, but some APRS software supports it) - sends
             information on the software version in use.

Note that queries and responses are one-off transmissions.
They are not retried and are not acknowledged.

2011/01/16 10:42am [aprsisce] Re: Tiny Web Pages

I would like to do something like this but I have no desire to run UI-View in order to do it. I did have a conversation with Lynn a few days ago about possible ways of doing it. I don't think it would be very easy to implement as a standalone program that connects to APRS-IS. At the least I think you would need a managed interface with APRSISCE/32 that would provide the third party add-in with information such as the position of the station wanting to get information and the commands they are sending. At best all the functionality would be in APRSISCE/32 itself and all the user had to do is provide the information.

1/16/2011 - 11:12am Re: [aprsisce] Re: AVRS

Now Lynn, all you need to do on the Kenwood interface is to auto-tune
the other side of the radio automatically when an AVRS request comes
in.

After talking with Bob about AVRS at Dayton waaaay back, I came home
and started playing with my D700 and simulated the AVRS functionality
with a terminal program. I came up with some conceptual settings for
operation.

Full manual: What you have right now, a message pops up telling you a
call is coming in on repeater XXX.
Semi Auto: Message comes in with a TUNE(able) frequency embedded, and
you simply need to hit the TUNE button.
Full Auto: Message comes in, pops up on screen and the other side of
the radio automatically tunes to the frequency.

Oh yeah, this was before the QSY function (inserting the other side
frequency into the position report) or TUNE functions were around
either. Those were functions that I was playing with as well, just had
no way to implement them. (There are a few concepts that I shared with
Bob that I think sparked some ideas...)

APRSISCE/32 could be the first on the block to be able to do the three
AVRS QSY modes.

Lynn can you set some thing up that will tell how far the stations are from me just by moving the mouse over to the station
Also is their a way that an old man with an eye and a half can change the coller of his station in the scroll windo so that I can see it when it beaconds
If you cand no big thing
Thank you
