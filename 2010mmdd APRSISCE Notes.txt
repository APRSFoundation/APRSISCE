Here's the major features in version 2013/mm/dd hh:mm





===================================================================================================================

Here's some details on the big stuff (raw Development version notes):


===========

Corrected case of ToCall translation from APDSXX to APDSxx for "APDSXX  SP9UOB for dsDigi and ds-tracker".  XX=literal, xx=variable.  (DP9PEE-2)

Corrected csT parsing for Altitude in compressed coordinates sourced from GGA.  (Krzysztof SQ5NWI)

=========== 2012/08/30 09:19

Don't activate Mic-E notifications on killed objects.  (YB2TJV's YC2ZBM emergency symbol)
YB2TJV>APU25N,TCPIP*,qAC,T2JKTPUS:;YC2ZBM   _242228z0743.55S\10945.65E!Posko Induk Lebaran 2011 Orari Lokal Keb

Correct (hopefully) units of Windspeed and Gusts.  My parser was confused as to what units applied to what packet element.  (KD5JZC)

Attempt to identify SSn-N path aliases.  See http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/menu:configure-aliases for details.

Show both Non-alias used hop count and Simplistic used hop count in the Digi/IGate column of the packet scroller.  

=========== 2012/08/30 23:40

Add Configure / Aliases / Accumulate toggle to enable parsing even with all Alias() trace logs disabled.

Save captured Possible and Unused-0 Aliases across restart and support Clear options.

Complete Configure / Aliases / ... menu option functionality (New, Enable/Disable, Make Known, Remove)  See http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/menu:configure-aliases for an idea of what these are supposed to do.

=========== 2012/08/31 08:02

Dev Mode Only: If you set a TestFilter (Control-G), then hit Control-I (Tab) for IGate, AND meet a bunch of other conditions, you should get asked if you want to "Set IGate Filter To... ".  If you say "Yes", the displayed current TestFilter will be used to arbitrarily gate packets from -IS to RF, but ONLY as long as all of the conditions are still met.  The only way to change the filter is to change the Test Filter and then do another Control-I.  The only way to clear the IGate filter is to restart APRSISCE/32, however if you disable the IGate(Filter) trace log, then gating will cease.
Conditions: Development mode, APRS-IS has IStoRF checked, At least one Xmit-enabled RF Port, FilterTest Trace Log is Enabled

The IGate Filter enabled is not remembered, but the value is.  After a restart, the Control-G filter will offer it as a default which can then be re-adopted into the IGate Filter via Control-I.  This is to make selecting the filter a very conscious decision until additional safeties are put in place.

Double-clicking the APRS-IS OK pane will show IStoRF: n if filtered packets have been gated.  

Don't gate messages from -IS to RF if the station was heard inside a 3rd party packet.  IGate capabilities and the ?IGATE query will include a PKT_CNT similar to MSG_CNT to show how many filtered packets have been gated since the program was started.

Don't count a 3rd-party wrapped station as HeardOnRF, only HeardAs3rd.

Don't gate messages from -IS to RF if source station was heard locally via RF per #2 at http://www.aprs-is.net/IGateDetails.aspx.  I use the same timer and hops as "Recently Local", namely 30 minutes and 2 used hops (double-click vertical bar just right of the map).  These will eventually be configurable.

Disable MeNot3rd (wasn't using port configuration checkbox anyway) as it borks other things.  Good idea, but I need to think more on it.

Detect and log, but don't learn, unused -0 alias following a used alias.  Still bogus, but don't know what digi might be busted or if it is an original SSn sans -N.  (W4POX-5)
W4POX-5>SVUP0Q,KB4ZIN-5*,WIDE1*,K4MQF-1*,NV4FM-5*,WIDE2*,VA2,qAR,KG4LAA:'h.#l #/]Portsmouth EOC

Include known aliases in the unused -0 detection.  Yep, that highlights a BUNCH more potentially bogus digipeaters!  You actually might not want to run Alias(-0) enabled on a full feed now.  (W1WAB-9 via KG4YZY-10)
W1WAB-9>R7TR8R,NI4CE-12*,KG4YZY-10*,WIDE2:`n1.l j/"46}

Correct New check when forcing output to the Alias(-0) trace log.  Funny what a big difference a ! makes.

Break out Alias(-0) to Alias(-0) Alias(Dbl-0) and Alias(First-0).  See http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/menu:configure-aliases (at the bottom) for details on what they mean.

Corrected View / Platforms / Unrecognized to only look at non-objects.  It was mistakenly only counting objects when it's the object originator that has the platform!

Replace View / Platforms / None count with Non-Object count instead of total station count.  This is the denominator for the percentage calculations so they'll make more sense now.

Expand View / Platforms / Experimental like Unrecognized to see the values after the >APZ.

Promote "aprx de OH2MQK" to a dedicated View / Platform category with 388 concurrent users over the past 2 hours.

Update platform determinator to trump weather-packet implied platform with ToCall-defined platform.  SQ3FYK WX/Digi was incorrectly appearing as WinAPRS.
You can expect the View / Platform numbers for the "APRS Software Types" listed on page 63 of aprs101.pdf to go down as these were being improperly categorized relative to the packet's ToCall.  These are APRSdos, MacAPRS, pocketAPRS, APRS+SA, WinAPRS, X-APRS.

Promote "SQ3FYK WX/Digi" to a dedicated View / Platform category now that it's no longer mis-categorized due to Weather.

Divorce Weather's "APRS Software Type" platform from the Station's platform type.  The weather's ostensible platform type is displayed along with the Unit in the station's popup window.

Move APTTxx (Tiny Trak) from Others to Byonics cascade in View / Platforms.

Promote "OpenAPRS" from Others to a dedicated View / Platform category with 72 concurrent users over the past 2 hours.

Identify UISS platform as {UISSnn} in the comment.  They really need to get an assigned ToCall as they're using >APRS generically.

Break out UI-View versions based on {UIVxxx} in comment and/or APU1/2/3xx ToCall.

=========== 2012/09/04 21:26

Restructure internal Transmit Pressure calculations.  Hopefully I didn't bork anything.

Verified that filters for -IS to RF IGating will not (at least, should not) gate a station that was recently heard locally on RF (same definitions as for gating messages from -IS to RF).

Support Configure / Companions to allow additional stations to be transmitted with their own GeniusBeaconing settings and (eventually) with full messaging capability.  This should answer the need for "tactical" callsign stations by enabling a Companion and disabling (or slowing down) your main station beacon.  Note that the messaging isn't done quite yet, but the beaconing is.  See the new Companions trace log after you've configured one.  All Companion comments will have "de <MYCALL-ssid>" appended automatically.  See KJ4ERJ-TC for an example.  (Colin & Liz)

=========== 2012/09/06 02:03

Preserve configured Companion GeniusBeaconing settings across restart.  (Oops)

Support Acking incoming messages for Companions if Messaging is enabled.  Goes into an Eavesdropping-style chat window with no way to directly respond (yet), but priority-wise it's second highest between ME and MY messages.

Give each companion their own timer for Configure / Status / Beacon / Interval (comment suppression).  One parameter drives it for the entire instance, but each Companion will get around to it on it's own timer.

Configure / Beacon selections drive the format and composition of the packet transmitted for a Companion except for Comment, RF Path, and whether or not Messaging is supported (based on the Companion's Messages checkbox).

=========== 2012/09/06 02:51

Attempt to diagnose why Companion Calls aren't transmitting from some fixed station instances.  KJ4ERJ-TC works from my KJ4ERJ-AL, but KJ4ERJ doesn't work from my KJ4ERJ-AP.  Hopefully I'll get it figured out.  Companion Calls should beacon fine from GPS-enabled instances.

Corrected non-GPS Companion Call transmissions.  Companion Calls are only checked when the configuration is changed or every 30 seconds.  They are not intended to be "real-time", but to follow along with your station.

Corrected Transmit menu option when used from a non-GPS station and the center was not moved.  It wasn't setting the internal "where am I" pseudo-GPS coordinates.

For non-GPS instances, update internal "Where Am I" pseudo-GPS timestamp every second for proper use by other program features (like Companion Calls).

Enable sending Companion Calls as Objects owned by ME.  (Untested, but included)

Correct AX.25-safe check for Companion Calls.  Had it backwards, Objects were checked, Stations weren't!  Wondered why I didn't get warned about KJ4ERJ-TC until I changed it to an Object!

=========== 2012/09/06 13:35

Correct Genius calculations for Companions.  Hopefully they'll beacon on more than Time when mobile with a GPS.  (KJ4ERJ-12/LWDCAR)

Correct checks for recently heard local before allowing an -IS to RF IGate for a station.  (Adam KC2ANT)

Add additional information on stations being Considered for -IS to RF IGating to the IGate(Filter) trace log.

=========== 2012/09/06 18:56

Correct GetDiskFreeSpace() diagnostic call to properly include path.  (Scott N3SW)

Suppress "PaintMainWindow:Shadow BitBlt" failure complaints to every 5 minutes unless the error changes.  These seem to happen when some chainges power down the display adapter.  (Sctot N3SW)

Reduce criticality level of some Altitude trace logs.  These alert for stations that a) don't always report altitude or b) move vertically w/o lat/lon change.

Add additional WM_CLOSE tracing to determine why WinMo version closes unexpectedly.

Support MiniDump creation on a detected crash.  This may create APRSIS32.DMP files in your execution directory that will assist me in determining the cause of crashes.

Add distance and bearing to local message interpretation of received Item-As-Message objects.  (Steve G6UIM)

=========== 2012/09/22 19:47

Don't queue an internal message for recalled Item-As-Message posits or QRU response eavesdropped messages.

Add distance and bearing to all intercepted Item-As-Messages, even if received as part of eavesdropping.

QRU queries now support an optional #N to limit (but not increase) the count of returned objects.  This can come before or after the optional range specifier, but the group always comes first (with or without ?).  (Steve G6UIM & DL1HXB-7)

=========== 2012/09/22 22:30

Always show "Chat w/Owner XXXXXX" in object popup menus.  This will be disabled if the object's owner doesn't appear to support messaging.  (Kevin W7BOZ)

===========  2012/09/23 07:28

Correct busted diagnostic printf in -IS to RF logic when it avoids gating a "ME" packet from -IS to RF.  Thank you MiniDump!  (Kim VK2ASY)

=========== 2012/09/24 09:45

Don't send Compressed coordinates in an Item-In-Message if they contain non-message-compatible (|{~) characters.  Note that you also cannot send a "Fog" (alternate table { symbol) object as an Item-In-Message.  (Steve G6UIM's GB3JL/2 and GB3NC/2 objects)

=========== 2012/09/24 17:15

(Hopefully) Corrected behavior of Transmit menu option to actually transmit even if you don't Move ME to Center.  (Type A Personalities: I want to transmit and I want to transmit NOW!)

Don't ask about moving ME (and disable the coordinate menu's Move ME HERE) if the zoom is too far out (<14, the same criteria as the initial set).  This will hopefully satisfy the request for disabling the question for the use-cases described.  If you're panning and transmitting at tight zoom, IMHO you deserve the question.  It also makes it consistent with the startup position setting requirement.  (Multiples...)

=========== 2012/09/25 09:05

Correct <IGATE capabilities packet busted when PKT_CNT= was added for -IS to RF IGating support.

Support port type of "Dummy" (connection type doesn't matter) to be a Transmit-Only Dummy Load for testing -IS to RF IGating in an RF-less environment.

Include version string in *.dmz/*.dmp files.

Include current (or last) packet being parsed in *.dmp file.  This is to aid debugging parser crashes in the future.

Restore handling of RBUTTONUP for context menu in map.  Hoping this restores function on Windows Tablets.

Bring all three platforms back to single Dev: version.

=========== 2012/09/27 07:39

Add a new Packets(NULL) to show packets whose payload is truncated due to containing NULL characters.

Count (but don't display anywhere yet) duplicate packets received from a station.  This is needed to calculate an accurate unique-packet rate.

Track (but don't display anywhere yet) the actual start time for hourly packet count buckets.  This is needed to calculate an accurate per minute rate.

Count "Oth" packets for any packet that doesn't fit a defined type.  These are the packets that a type (t/) filter can't pick up from a filtered feed.  These packet counts are display on the port status windows (right click in APRS-IS OK pane).

Restore StationMemory diagnostic window if it exists when selected from APRS-IS OK right click menu.

Restore including trailing spaces in CRC calculations used by duplicate packet detector.  This may cause additional "Invalid" or "Too Fast" track points to be introduced by space-adding IGates.

Add a "Busy Stations" option to the APRS-IS OK right click menu.  This will bring up two windows that refresh every 10 minutes and show the highest (non-duplicate) packet rates (per minute) for Fixed (no tracks) and Mobile (has tracks) stations.  If you see any abnormally high rate stations in your area, check aprs.fi's raw logs (or do a Control-G b/<Call-SSID> test filer) and see what's up.  If it looks like they're not adhering to local APRS usage standards, give them a call.  And if it's you're own station, you can toggle on Configure / Beacon / Why to see what's triggering the rate.  Note: The first number is the current clock hour minutely rate.  The () number is the previous clock hour rate.

Make that THREE windows.  I just added a Busy on RF window.  For now, it gets created all the time.  Eventually, I might detect if there's actually an RF port configured.

=========== 2012/09/27 23:31

Ok, so I didn't think through the RF window.  It was still showing the total (IS+RF-Dupes) packet rates.  It now shows raw RF, but unfortunately this also includes digipeater dupes, so don't go challenging anyone on this one just yet!

=========== 2012/09/27 23:40

The zoom check on the coordinates cascade was backwards causing Move ME HERE to only appear when zoomed OUT, not zoomed IN.  Fixed.  (Arthur N4TRQ)

.DMP file names now include APRSIS32 version timestamp, CALLSIGN, and current time (in UTC).

If APRSIS32 generates a .DMP/DMZ file, it will automatically restart.  Eventually it'll even auto-detect the .DMPs and offer to send them to me.

=========== 2012/09/30 06:39

Beef up Non-AX.25 error trace log to include the value of the byte that is expected to be zero.  (Steve G6UIM + one other?)

Fix new Packets(NULL) trace log to not complain about every KISS and/or AGW received packet.

Further beef up AX.25 error trace logs to determine why the java AX.25 soundcard interface isn't working.  (Steve G6UIM)

Make a dark gray DFS circle for non-reception (zero S units) objects.  This is completely UNTESTED.  (James VE6SRV)

=========== 2012/10/06 07:31

Separate Symbol(Emergency) Mic-E status from EMERGENCY for individual controllability. - Not sure if this is actually working right yet though.

Correct {UISSnn} truncation crash.

Support Busy Stations and Busy RF Stations windows sorted by traffic rate (right click on APRS-IS OK pane).

Capability packets now go out over APRS-IS if enabled, regardless of Beaconing on the APRS-IS port.

If a dump file is created due to internally detected programming exception, APRSIS32 is automatically restarted.  This allows for better unattended IGate operations.

Correct "Move xxxx HERE" menu option to appear at the proper zoom levels. 

=========== 2013/02/13 16:50

Update latest application identifiers from http://www.aprs.org/aprs11/tocalls.txt

Correct View / EchoLinks to zero-fill node numbers less than 6 digits.  (EL-022440)

Support parsing the obsolete GridSquare ([) packet format.  (Hans PA3GJM)

Add the course direction to the DF angle for drawing purposes.  Station Information will still show the orginal DF angle.  (Lodewijk PA3BNX)

=========== 2013/05/24 20:57

Support Screen / Brightness / Bright/Dim which changes the background of the transparent maps from White to Black.  Discovered on APRSISDR.  (Adam KC2ANT)

Define APWAxx as APRSISDR and group under View / Platforms / APRSISCE/32, define as supporting Item-As-Message (even though it doesn't yet!)

The NMEA port now supports a direct TCP/IP connection to GPSd.  Simply configure the NMEA port to use TCP/IP and point it to your GPSd instance.  If you've never heard of GPSd, don't worry about it.  If you've got a GPSd already running, then I don't need to tell you more, right?  (Steve G6UIM)

Parse date/time from $GPZDA and put the first received xx, yy offsets into the NMEA trace log even if disabled.  (Steve G6UIM)

ANSRVR now prefixes all (I think) communications with N:group to allow client-side segregation

=========== 2013/07/19 06:26

Define Yaesu's new FTM-400DR and FT-1D platforms.  These are included in the non-AX.25 APRS messaging warning pending further testing.  Anyone know someone that owns one?

Define APOLUx as OSCAR/AMSAT-LU platform.

Change APWAxx from APRSISCE4droid to APRSISDR.  (Note: this will be changing again sometime)  (Lynn KJ4ERJ)

Replace obsolete "Me not 3rd" with "NoGate ME" in RF port configuration.  This will prevent gating your own received packets back to the APRS-IS to allow monitoring of actual RF received paths at remote IGates.  This is only recommended for Satellite APRS operations.  (Mark MM1MPB)

Disabled the yet-to-be-implemented RF Baud dropdown in port configuration.

Increase max configurable server zoom from 18 to 20.  (Fred N7FMH)

Improve red/green colorization for DOP bars behind altitude pane.  Also, colorize GPS Fix pane if PDOP is known.  (Steve G6UIM)

=========== 2013/09/25 04:26

Improve initialization of Chat's Rf/IS-Only/Best checkbox based on message, xmit, Internet, and port enabled status.

Completely disable Chat Send button if no ports are message-transmit capable.

Colorize chat message lines still awaiting acks.

=========== 2013/10/29 06:31

Control-C (Copy) in message boxes (like station info pop-ups) now include the window title.  (Greg Anderson)

=========== 2013/10/29 07:11

Corrected Screen / Paths / Appearance Medium and Long time Expert value settings.  (KJ4ERJ-2)

=========== 2013/10/29 15:15

Added zoom number in center of slider (breaks if/when I do fractional zooms).  (Greg KB3KBR, Fred N7FMH)

The zoom number turns green (it might be hard to read) when you're zoomed in close enough to "Move ME".  (Greg KB3KBR)

=========== 2014/11/14 10:55

Don't require a leading <C0> on KISS packets (Erik N0OWT)

Support new platforms from http://www.aprs.org/aprs11/tocalls.txt, specifically:
{ "APCWP8", "WinphoneAPRS" },
{ "APMIxx", "PLX Digi/Tracker" },
{ "APSMSx", "SMS Gateway" },
{ "APSMSx", "SMS gateway" },
{ "APSTMx", "W7QO's Balloons" },
{ "APZWKR", "GM1WKR NetSked", PLATFORM_EXPERIMENTAL },

Fix memory leak when parsing a JT65 log file (only noticed this because my JT65 log was huge)

When driving a GPX file, only print diagnostics if the queued tile count changes instead of every update interval.

Correct formatting of weather station's battery voltage.

=========== 2015/06/05 09:35

Ignore single character !shriek!s (!x! being put out by N5ETC-2)

Properly parse local time (/) format specifier (Jerry KF5AOK)

Identify 2 new Yaesu Mic-E types

Identify latest ToCall additions

=========== 
=========== 
=========== 





Save expiration timestamped NWS message packets for resurrection after restart as well as to repopulate the upcoming Weather Board.
Complete saving and recalling RcvdWeather and purge on timer somehow...

Support IgnoreEavesdrops (by source) if I can figure out where to specify it.  Configure / Messages / Ignore Eaves / None ala Configure / DX / Ignore to clear.

Fix failed parse datatypes to default entire packet as Chapter 19 implied Status Report (nolatlon/break as in Telemetry)

Immediately check the transmit queue for a port-specific digipeat with no viscous delay.  (Steve G6UIM)

Ensure that port transmits show up in the Port(name) trace log, regardless of actual BT/Serial/TCPIP connection type..

Attributes: http://www.aprs.org/symbols.html

ATTRIBUTE TYPES: All of the symbols shown above are in WHITE which is the representation of the symbol when it is transmitted by a fully capable APRS platform, usually meaning it can send and receive messages. For example, if the station is a dumb-tracker with no message capability then it is displayed in GRAY. The following table describes all of the SYMBOL ATTRIBUTES in APRS and the color used in most cases to convey them on the map. This list is in ascending order meaning you start at the top and assign any color that applies. The last color applied is the one that sticks.

WHITE: . . . . . . . A Full-up APRS station that is message capable
GRAY: . . . . . . . . A Tracker or other station without message capability
CYAN: . . . . . . . . A moving station with CSE/SPEED or a Dead Reckoned Station
BLUE(dark) . . . . The previous position of a MOVED station or object
YELLOW: . . . . . Your own active OBJECTS you are transmitting to the net
VIOLET: . . . . . . Objects placed on the map by others
Dark GRAY: . . . Old Symbols not updated in the last 80 minutes or more
BLACK: . . . . . . Old Symbols that have been "killed" by the originator
RED: . . . . . . . . . Emergency, Alarmed, or otherwise unknown symbols
CIRCLE: . . . . . . Circles show the size of a position's ambiguity (0.1, 1, 10 or 60 mi)
ACTIVITY BIT . This bit indicates if an operator is present. The map can be selected to show only manned stations

            End of Release Notes...ToDo List Follows
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The following ToDos were last updated on 1/21/2011  (Ok, so I REALLY need to revisit this whole list!)
If you've suggested something to be done (and have actually read this far)
and it's not listed below, please re-ask for it and I'll try to get it on
the list this time.

To Dos:  (Still Incomplete and always getting LONGER instead of SHORTER!)

Nickname-selectable track color for persistence

Abiltity to transmit a nickname's label (and symbol?) to TACTICAL

Capture and parse (ts) symbol definitions from TACTICAL callsigns

Figure out how to suppress (multi-Poly?) track lines and MultiLines that jump across the screen - Particularly Satellites.

Symbol-based? Speed-based? DR-based? earlier expiration times for stations that travel out of range (to remove satellites from the screen when they fly by).

Top item to be done: RF-Port specific tracking and use, Multi-Port AGW Support, UI-View Maps

When disabling an NWS office, ask if it should be removed from the list.  (wellmanl)

DX Trace log shows distances in miles even if Configure / Metric / Distance is checked for Kilometers.

Support a minimum distance and minimum interval for DX classification and >DX transmissions.  (Julian G4ILO)

Auto-Wrap (and highlight?) long received messages in Chat windows to "fix" viewing messages from non-compliant clients.

Allow a single MultiTrack to track multiple stations and keep them visible via auto-zoom.  Use this for the auto-popup of multiple objects received from a QRU response.  (Adam KC2ANT)

Check operation of single-digit directories in the OSM layer.  It may have gotten borked.

New/Local/All popup display similar to D710 when packets are received
Implement a compass direction/distance screen for homing in on GeoCaches or Stations / Objects
You already have the ability to click on an object and the program will tell you how far away it is, and in what direction.  Could you also include a computation for how long it would take to get to the object from where you are?  This would be strictly in a vector sense (no expectation of following roads on the map - I know that's not possible), based on your current velocity and direction.  A graphic of the direction instead of the 16-point compass rose designation would also be good.  ("10 minutes, THAT way.") (Greg KO6TH)
The final feature would be to chain a set of objects in a row, as a rudimentary path from, say, aid station 1, to aid station 2, to aid station 3, and so forth.  The time to an object would be computed from the sum of each segment between where you are and the object of interest and your current headway to the first one.  I know this borders on functionality in a modern GPS, but the key difference is that the objects (waypoints in GPS-speak) can be either ones you set, or ones that others set via APRS.  As tactical things change in the APRS space, your target and path can change in real time to follow.  So now if I need to pick up something from Sam, and then Sally, I can enter their SSIDs into a chain and find them even if they move, stopping off at the canteen (private object) on the way back. (Greg KO6TH)

Interpret $PKWDPOS and Yaesu equivalent as some sort of station if not "really" heard on APRS.
Show station counts in View / RF menu, especially RemoteRF, -IS Capable and -IS Only

Fix length of ?APRSS query response to avoid wrapping as a long message
Enable/Disable message group message capture and/or display
-IS to RF IGated messages should be transmitted on the heard station's Alternate Network ID (if specified), not APRSISCE/32's.

Buffer long (non-split) chat messages as single line to allow for changing length before transmission if path changes or degrades.
If sending a non-acked message via APRS-IS to a station that appears to be RF-linked, queue a secondary copy 31 seconds delayed.
Dupe detector needs to clear out redundantly received, non-acked (or ack'd as well, but send a new ack) messages so remote queries / commands don't get multi-processed.

Color callsign menus in Monitor chat window to match text (Colin 2E0XSD)
I am putting together a mobile laptop running Aprsisce/32 for a friend. He mentioned how hard, and dangerous it is to send APRS messages while driving. Texting and driving not good. So I thought, how about some "Quik keys or Macros". Press say F1 for a pre-set message. It would then enter the text into the message box. Seems easy enough. Is this something that could be worked into the program? (Kevin W7BOZ)
Context-aware internal messages like "New Version Available" offering "Download Now".
When you know there is an update and you go to About to download the new version, on restart, it asks "You have # messages.  Do you want to restart"?   Can you reset the message thing is the message is "just the UPDATE"? (Robert Giuliano KB8RCO)

Show multi-object info in Station popup.
Name current (not me) owner in Object menu and dialog (title?)
Put objects into APRSISOB.XML configuration file separate from APRSISCE/32.XML for sharability?

G6UIM - 9/13/2010 5:56pm
Hi all

Have been chatting with our glorious leader (thats Lynn) about a satellite mode. I will see if I can remember 
all that was said in email and over APRS and put down here for thoughts and comments.

I have been trying to get a contact via the ISS using APRSIS32 and at the moment I have to shut off the IS 
feed to get a message to go via RF. Not ideal as I would like to gate received messages over IS for others.

So with this in mind I came up with the following thoughts

Sat Mode:
Summary:
Gate all But not your own messages
Possible option to allow a buddy to use your station to attempt a Sat contact.
use hearing your own message back from the Sat as an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you dont tie up the Sat and give others a chance.
Show RF vs IS messages in Chat, Colorization?  Text?  Symbol <>?
Configurable default to NoAck chats (for satellite instances)


Details... 

Only thought about using one RF port so thoughts on having a Sat specific port in a multiport setup would be good.

Force the message over an RF port and not via IS. So the station you are trying to contact will receive the 
message hopefully via Satellite and not via IS from you.

Gate received messages from the RF port to IS so you are a help to others as an RX SGATE. 

Do not gate messages received on IS to RF as flooding the Sat with messages is not helpful. 

A reasonable retry rate as getting into the Sat can be hard, it will hear lots of stations that you wont so 
TX collisions are inevitable, and you have a limited time. use hearing your own message back from the Sat as 
an ack or possibly also via the sat over IS. So you dont tie up the Sat and give others a chance.

Also either ignore messages over IS or highlight they came from either IS or RF so you can see you made a 
contact over the Sat.

Am sure I have forgotten to add a few things above. And have stated the obvious a bit in places.

Thoughts on the above would be good.

 You could take that further why use radio at all, I have the internet on my phone, and a phone on my err phone. 
And people do ask why I bother with CB

Well maybe not a special port.

I agree on the manual send and abort, the ability to keep clicking send until you get a reply then kill the 
message would be good (with ack turned off).

Although the auto retry and except digi as an ack would be good in some instances, or at least a warning a digi 
was received.

At the moment I use 2 instances of aprsis one with IS turned off that I use to transmit and the other with IS 
turned on to see if anyone has received me.

I could do it with one, with what I was suggesting and also be able to gate received stations to IS.

It's another example of the absurdity of our hobby. Why would you want to send a message to someone by bouncing 
it off a satellite when you are both connected to the internet anyway?  :)  Just to see if it is possible. Which 
is why I would agree with Steve that it would be useful to have an option to prevent beacons and messages 
originated by you from being sent to -IS whilst still allowing messages received over RF to be gated.

I'm not sure what the purpose of a special satellite port would be. When I operate through the ISS I'm using my 
normal 2m setup tuned to the satellite frequency. I run a separate copy of APRSISCE/32 with its own XML file 
containing the satellite beacon text, path with RS0ISS-4, increased beacon frequency etc.

There were a couple of features I would like to see in a "satellite mode" which I kept quiet about because I 
figured they were not really a top priority. Now I'm not sure if I could remember them all.

I would prefer messaging in satellite mode to default to "no ack". You don't always remember to untick the ack 
box and you don't really want people trying to ack back through the space station.

Rather than have a message resent automatically at frequent intervals as Steve suggested I would prefer to 
control the sending manually so I can try to pick the right moment to send it. So what I would like is for 
the text of the message not to disappear when it is sent so I can try again without having to retype it.

None of these suggestions make any sense in the context of "normal" APRS so I would understand if it was felt 
that it was not appropriate for APRSISCE to support them.

Hi Lynn,

Had a re think.

I like the idea of the manual send rather than auto. So basically an ack less message box, you type the message 
in and it gets sent when you click send, but the the message still displays on screen and gets sent again when 
you click send. You need to manually remove the box.

Obviously send the message only via RF.

Keep the IS fully functional apart from not gating IS to RF.

My original thought was not receive messages from IS but thats bad as blocks messages that might get sent from others.

So 3 message receive modes.

Receive all messages however they arrive, for when you dont mind if the message comes direct from the sat or is 
gated onto IS by another station. Or direct from the other station.

Dont display messages on IS from the station/s you are trying to send to via the sat. for when you want an RF 
only QSO with the station but still want to receive from others.

Dont display any message that comes in on IS. (perhaps they could be stored and displayed when out of sat mode)

Have this configurable on a port basis as some people might want to have a radio on the normal APRS freq and 
another running for Satellites. Would need path and beacon on a port by port basis.

More notes from 2010/12/13:

Hi Lynn,

My thoughts, for whatever they're worth...
What I miss is simply a list of stations heard and their status and other data, in reverse order of receipt.  
The three item list in the upper left corner is barely long enough to see something of interest when you're 
watching the screen.  It's useless for this purpose if you turn you attention elsewhere for even a moment.  
My Kenwood TH-D7 has, effectively, both forms.  When a station is heard, it's displayed on the front panel 
and announced with a cheerful beep.  A quick flick of the stick and you can see the details.  Or, you can hit 
the List button and scroll back through time to review the last 40 events.

I suppose your design intent is that if you want to see what's going on around you, you'd just look at the map.  
Whether fed from RF or IS, objects appear on the map as received, and if you click on them, all the data gets 
displayed.  The problem is that events of some (mild) interest often occur off-map, and looking at a map gives 
little to no clue at the age of the data.  Yes, slowly graying out a station helps here, but there's no sequence 
information which could be useful in the field.  While I am annoyed when my D7 cheerfully beeps and informs me 
of a wide-too-many station's beacon dutifully digipeated from hundreds of miles away, I am also informed by 
weather information from the region beyond the bounds of my typical monitoring area.  Periodically zooming the 
map out (polling) to see if anything is there is a less effective than requesting (pulling) a list of the last 
50 or so events. 

For me, the particular call sign is less important as an initial sort; reverse time order (newest first) is better.
Then, I might request a sort by call sign or distance from me.  I think this is also best from a CPU load perspective.

Given the large set of entries from the IS feed, I would probably want to not save station information if they 
were more than some distance from me (configurable, of course).  Information without a position included would 
only be seen in the screen event scroll.  This should keep the list from being flushed through with locally 
irrelevant events too quickly.
Greg  KO6TH

I agree Greg, And adding the ability to apply the current filter (ie distance) and perhaps even a list# limit 
of say 100 stations. This would present me a list of the last 100 stations in the local 50 miles and NOT a 
complete list of Lynn's 17,000.

I think this would be useful and is used on all the Kenwood and Yaesu APRS radios.




12/30/2010 10:59am - Queries from Keih VE7GDH

Looking at the HELP from UI-View...

APRS Queries
UI-View32 supports the following APRS query messages. To send one
of these queries to another station, simply key it in like a normal message.
When receiving a query, UI-View32 responds as follows:-

?APRSP - sends a location beacon.
?APRSS - sends the status text.
?APRSO - sends your active objects.
?APRSD - sends a list of stations that have been heard direct.
?APRST (or ?PING?) - sends the route by which the query was received.
?APRSH <callsign> - sends information on when <callsign> was last heard.
?VER? (not an APRS query, but some APRS software supports it) - sends
             information on the software version in use.

Note that queries and responses are one-off transmissions.
They are not retried and are not acknowledged.

2011/01/16 10:42am [aprsisce] Re: Tiny Web Pages

I would like to do something like this but I have no desire to run UI-View in order to do it. I did have a conversation with Lynn a few days ago about possible ways of doing it. I don't think it would be very easy to implement as a standalone program that connects to APRS-IS. At the least I think you would need a managed interface with APRSISCE/32 that would provide the third party add-in with information such as the position of the station wanting to get information and the commands they are sending. At best all the functionality would be in APRSISCE/32 itself and all the user had to do is provide the information.

1/16/2011 - 11:12am Re: [aprsisce] Re: AVRS

Now Lynn, all you need to do on the Kenwood interface is to auto-tune
the other side of the radio automatically when an AVRS request comes
in.

After talking with Bob about AVRS at Dayton waaaay back, I came home
and started playing with my D700 and simulated the AVRS functionality
with a terminal program. I came up with some conceptual settings for
operation.

Full manual: What you have right now, a message pops up telling you a
call is coming in on repeater XXX.
Semi Auto: Message comes in with a TUNE(able) frequency embedded, and
you simply need to hit the TUNE button.
Full Auto: Message comes in, pops up on screen and the other side of
the radio automatically tunes to the frequency.

Oh yeah, this was before the QSY function (inserting the other side
frequency into the position report) or TUNE functions were around
either. Those were functions that I was playing with as well, just had
no way to implement them. (There are a few concepts that I shared with
Bob that I think sparked some ideas...)

APRSISCE/32 could be the first on the block to be able to do the three
AVRS QSY modes.

Lynn can you set some thing up that will tell how far the stations are from me just by moving the mouse over to the station
Also is their a way that an old man with an eye and a half can change the coller of his station in the scroll windo so that I can see it when it beaconds
If you cand no big thing
Thank you

I'm good with that, I was snooping at Bob's TWP page, and he used + as
a bullet for the list, which I suggested as a lead character. It just
needs to be something to indicate that the group would be a TWP object
response.

Yup, you've got the concept... Do we need to add another message
destination, or can we use one of these?

A message such as QST ?NETS might work, but that would end up showing
up on all clients as a received message. The Kenwood radios all
default to capturing these messages and showing them to the user.

If we defined another message group that didn't display on to the
user, but rather just triggered the TWP output, that might be better.

What about a message group called QRU (Have you anything for me?)

QRU ?HOSP (Do you have any information about local hospitals?)

Yes, it is indeed an issue if clients respond to these queries over
the internet feed. You even have contention issues if you just stay on
RF only. Ignore any issues with internet feeds for now. Sending out a
QRU ?GAS query might be received by a number of stations that have the
ability to respond. Do you really want objects spewed out showing gas
stations by a station that is 2 hops away, perhaps 100 miles away?
Maybe while implementing this concept, a distance limit might be
useful. The user could define a maximum distance from the querying
station to send objects. ie. If I hear a query from a local station,
and my max distance is 20 miles, I'll send any objects that are
located within 20 miles of the station sending the query. The object
might be 40 miles from me, but within 20 miles of the querying
station. Conversely, if the station sending the query is 50 miles from
me, and I don't have any objects within 20 miles of the querying
station, I don't send anything.

Also, have the query able to include a distance that the querying
station can send. ie. QRU ?HOSP 50 would send a request for hospitals
within 50 miles. The 50 at the end of the query would over ride the
user's default distance limit, allowing users to look for queried
objects further afield if required.

On the same page. Now, time to ensure that you're not creating
artificial boundaries. Remember that APRS defines the packets that
move around, but not how the programs use those packets. You have run
into that a number of times, where the APRS packet structure is
defined in the APRS 101 document, but what the heck do you do with it?

APRSISCE/32 could be the vehicle to define the generic TWP
implementation. Don't wait for ratification of the implementation of
the concept by the masses. Define it, implement it, and release it to
the world. Perhaps some of the other clients out there may jump on the
bandwagon and implement it, while others that are locked in the past
may not be able to support the concept.

The TWP concept isn't defined in the APRS 101 document, but it uses
conveyances that are defined in the document. I say APRSISCE/32 needs
to lead the way, and define a new way of delivering TWP information in
a smart manner.

Now if we could only do something with that mouthful of a name!

Jeff and I were having a conversation Friday about APRS and telemetry. I have no idea how it works..... but. Since I have my Echolink node up and running I am going to need away to control it remotely. I have heard of people using this for home automation over APRS. Instead of me setting up a whole new radio system I was thinking about using telemetry over APRS to do this. I could send telemetry info, or APRS-DTMF (Needs to be done, see Bobs page) over APRS to do this.
The Feature Request that I have is for Aprsisce to be able to decode this telemetry. And could be used to control signal lines on a LPT port. I know this would probably take a lot of work on your part. Or maybe not. We use to build, (and I still have them) TNC's that ran off the LPT port. Used a simple Bell202 chip (I think, would have to look at it) for the tones used for Packet/APRS. Can't recall the name of it :) Anyway getting off topic. Used a type of KISS mode or HOST software.
Anyway, an addition to Aprsisce to be able to set telemetry definitions to control output on LPT port. Reading the aprsig group posts really got me thinking on this telemetry thing. Please don't kill the idea, but give me some feedback and thoughts. If it is possible for someone to be able to interface with Aprsisce to do this, I can find a programmer so you don't have to deal with it. But I think that Telemetry control over APRS/APRSISCE to do all kinds of stuff would be a HUGE benefit.
If this can not be done, maybe I can find a way for a simple TNC to simultaneously monitor the signal lines. This would be receive only, and would like Bi-Directional in and out confirmation.
So what are your thoughts on this?

30 seconds seems a bit long to me. I would have thought 5 seconds would be enough. If you are going to do that I wounder if it would be an idea to include a random delay before responding, so that if someone sends a request that is heard by two stations that can respond, the responses are less likely to collide with each other?

For some time now, I have been referring to Google Traffic for an opening to head for home. 
I am curious how they acquire data. I have been wondering how to use the speed data from 
APRS equipped vehicles for an APRS traffic flow packet. The simple method is to just view 
the packet of a station travelling along. I suspect it could be pushed further like actually 
seeing in big numbers the actual speed on a map. Now that could be real service for those 
commuters that look for alternate paths when the going is slow. Maybe I will mention that 
to Lynn as an idea.

Subj: [aprsisce] Map Tiles default

We have several sets of map tiles defined (we're up to five, some from 
on-line sources, some from local), and each of them works just fine.

The last one was added recently and I've been going around and copying 
the tiles to different computers and setting up the configuration, all 
without problems.

The default tileset is not the one most recently added, so I switch to 
the usual one.  However, the new one continues to be default, not the 
one being used when restarting or exit/start (I've been trying 
alternative ways of getting another tileset to "stick", but no success, 
not that there are many alternatives).

Looking at the XML file, each of the TileServer sections is present and 
appears to be the same format.  Just above the TileServer sections is a 
section of <OSM.xxxx> entries, which is currently specifying the new 
tileset.  I suspect that this section should show the tileset being used 
when APRSIS32 is closed or restarted.

Should the program be updating this section, or have I been missing a 
manual method to specify a default tileset?

This program has us hooked, and the hook is set.  When Lynn is able to 
devise alternate methods to place objects by coordinate and read 
coordinates of a point on the map (other than manually moving the 
cursor), we'll be able to get rid of additional programs.  No this isn't 
a new request, it's already on Lynn's list (we hope, we hope).

What are we needing this for?  We're Search and Rescue.  Comm provides 
cellphone coordinates of lost/injured caller, maybe good, maybe not 
(more and more the coords are relevant and not for a distant cell 
tower).  Coords are nothing (just a pile of numbers) until you plot 
them, in whatever format they are provided (decimal degrees, usually). 
Then we translate the coords to our standard decimal minutes (same as 
aviation and same as APRS) and recite them to the helicopter.  Then I 
point at a helispot next to the trail that is relatively close to the 
exhausted hiker and recite coordinates to the bird.  They land, walk 15 
minutes up-trail and provide water and support to the patient, and 
assist her to the bird (not running!).  Then I point to a helipad where 
we'd like the patient delivered, and recite more coordinates.

Meanwhile the map continues to display the area of the operation.  If I 
try to do all of this with only APRSIS32, I have to be parked on the 
side of the road.  I have to reset the map to different points at high 
zoom with different tilesets that show points the best.  And I have to 
calculate the format changes by hand.  Bah!  Not gonna happen.

So I use a second mapping application.  Place a waypoint on the map, 
change display format, edit coords, change display format back to 
decimal minutes, done deal.  And I can do this at a traffic light (the 
only advantage of red lights is having a few moments to work on map). 
Way too complex for APRSIS32, so far.  The purpose of relating this tale 
is not so much to entertain y'all, but to give Lynn an opportunity to 
sit in my seat.  Perhaps he would like to be able to handle these needs 
by using APRSIS32.  Maybe not.  His program.  His choice.  The example 
is real, and typical, from the day before yesterday (Sunday).

Anyway, we're certainly happy with APRSIS32 and are still busy creating 
mapsets (thanks to the available on-line sources, and to Global Mapper 
for supporting the OSM tileset format), and we are still creating more 
GPX files of trails in our area (thanks to Google Earth, and to Global 
Mapper for translating KMZ to GPX, and to APRSIS32 for providing GPX 
attributes for displaying the files).  Yeah, other programs can create 
the GPX files, but while I'm using Global Mapper anyway ...

Returning from my digression: So what about setting the default tileset?
