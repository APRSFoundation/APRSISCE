Here's what's new in the APRSISCE6P100820.zip and APRSIS32100820.zip

About version is 2010/08/20 05:30 (or later by now)

Appliation Identifier (ToCall) is now APWW04 (APRSIS32) and APWM04 (APRSISCE) (filter of u/APWW*/APWM* still works)

The biggest thing is probably the multi-line messages. The Send Message dialog now supports up to 5 lines of 67 characters (the spec limit) and automatically word wraps the lines into multiple APRS messages.  Sequential messages to a single callsign-SSID are now sent FIFO (First In First Out) as acks are received.  This ensures delivery in the same sequence as the message was sent.

If multiple messages are heard before being viewed, all of the messages are put into a single message box with timestamps showing when they were received.  In a "My Messages" or "Eavesdrop" mode, an entire conversion is pulled into a single MessageBox() as well.

Also, the Send Message dialog now has an Ack checkbox which defaults to checked.  If you know you're sending to a station that doesn't ack, and want to send just a single copy of the message, don't check ack and APRSISCE/32 won't supply a message identifier (the spec way of asking for an ack).  This usage is not recommended as no retries are provided for the outbound message.

APRSISCE/32 now supports Bulletins - both configuration and transmission and reception and viewing.  Look for Messages / Bulletins / Create and Messages / Bulletins / View.  If Messages / Bulletins / Notify is checked, a notification will be queued whenever a new or changed bulletin is received.  You can only delete bulletins via the XML file at the current time.

Objects are now configurable via a dialog instead of only through editing the XML.  Look for Configure / Objects / Create.  If you check Configure / Objects / Show, all of your objects will be displayed on your map, regardless of enable/disable status.  Note that they are not yet clickable on the map and can only be deleted via the XML file.

The most recently loaded valid XML configuration file is saved (-Safe) and used if a corrupt file is detected preserving the most recent "good" settings.  This allows a graceful recovery from user-edited (or program-screwups) XML corruptions.

(Hopefully) Corrected initial configuration prompt for OSMTiles location on Windows Mobile.  Let me know if this is still not working right.

Attempt to relocate configuration dialogs so that focused control is visible on too-small screens.  I'm told this breaks on a dual-monitor configuration, so more work is obviously needed.

Center all dialogs above main window, ensure visibliity on monitor - This seems to be broken in dual-monitor environments

OSMTiles information now includes Size vs Disk size information in popup.  I thought cluster rounding was making the tiles consume more space, but that does not appear to be the case.

Configure / Screen / Crosshairs with options of Always, Never, or Timed will put crosshairs at the center of the screen to make object and "Me" placement more precise.  Timed mode will show crosshairs when the screen is panned or zoomed for <> milliseconds.

Configure / Screen / Circle now makes the range circle appear or disappear.

Configure / Screen / RedDot makes the GeniusBeaconing forecast Red Dot (http://aprsisce.wikidot.com/red-dot) appear or disappear.

Configure / Beacon / Comment / New now allows setting custom comment text on the fly.  It also prompts for remembering the comment as a selection in the pop-out menu.  A temporary comment is not saved if you answer "No".

Configure / Beacon / Path now prompts for the default beacon path instead of requiring an XML edit.  This path will be inherited by all suitably-flagged RF Ports.

In preparation for future changes and to better support the small screens, I've implemented my own MessageBox replacement.  It does scroll-bars if the text is too tall or wide for the screen.  Otherwise, it should work like the standard MessageBox() API, but as Julian (G4ILO) pointed out, "it looks like Windows 3.1".  I'll be working on the visual appearance over time.

In Windows Mobile, several of the screens hide the SIP button in the bottom center, especially those screens for which keyboard input doesn't make sense.  However, I've noticed that WinMo doesn't always honor this and sometimes it pops back into existance without warning.

The Clear Tracks menu option now updates the displayed circle without the tracks immediately.

RF Ports now support packet logging.  Simply check Enables / RF Ports / Log All and files of the form <Callsign-SSID-yyyymmdd-hhmm.pkt> will be created containing each packet received on all RF ports.  The time the packet was received and the port name are included in the log file.  Note that the file is opened and closed for each packet, so a high-traffic port may cause a performance issue.

The Digipeater logic no longer repeates packets that originated from or include the configured callsign-SSID in the used path.

For AGW-based digipeaters, fixed a packet parser error casuing badly formed transmit paths.  This still seems to be busted as the path "used" flag doesn't seem to transmit?

The individual <callsign-SSID> buddy trace logs have been merged into a single "Buddies" trace log.

CaSe SeNsItIvE callsign checking in special and message groups - Hopefully this won't break like the pirated ack case sensitivity broke!

When in Eavesdrop or My Messages mode, closing only warns you if pending messages were addressed directly to you

New version available reminder check is fixed (it never worked before), see <Update.ReminderInterval> (default 7 days)

Range check Lat/Lon so corrupt packets from development APRSBB don't hose map view


Menu changes:

1) Enables / RF Ports / Log All - Enables packet logging to disk for all RF ports

2) Messages / Eavesdrop - Intercepts and displays ALL messages received.  Kind of extreme on a full feed or t/m filtered port!

3) Messages / Bulletins / ... - APRS Bulletin support

4) Configure / Beacon / Comment - Change your commente and/or select from a pre-configured one

5) Configure / Objects / ... - APRS Object support

6) Configure / Screen / Circle+CrossHairs+RedDot - Customize your screen elements

7) Configure / Screen / Tracks has been removed as it is redundant with Screen / Tracks


Dialog changes:

1) Send Message now supports Ack and multi-line text entry

2) New Messages / Bulletins / Create configuration dialog

3) New Configure / Objects / Create configuration dialog


APRSISCE - Windows Mobile specific changes:

1) The date is no longer displayed in trace log output to conserve screen space.

2) Bulletin and message notifications now have an informational icon.

3) Messages / Bulletin / View removes all pending bulletin notifications

4) Only kick Communications Manager every 30 seconds instead of very fast


New XML configuration file elements:
<CommentChoice> - Configure / Beacon / Comment
<Stations.AvgIntervals> - Future use
<Stations.AvgCount> - Future use
<Enables.RFPktLog> - Enables / RFPorts / Log All
<Enables.AllMessages> - Messages / Eavesdrop
<Screen.Circle> - Configure / Screen / Circle
<Screen.RedDot> - Configure / Screen / RedDot
<Screen.CrossHairs> - Configure / Screen / CrossHairs (-1=always, 0=none, 1=timed)
<Screen.CrossHairTime> - Manually configured for CrossHairs=??? (default 1000msec)
<Object.Enabled> - Configure / Objects - Enabled checkbox
<Bulletin.*> - Bulletin configuration


Performance enhancements including:
a) Cache DNS lookups as this can take a LONG time
b) Randomly select APRS-IS server to reduce reconnect delays
c) Turn of "Nagel Algorithm" on APRS-IS connection
d) Reduce repurposed TCP timer from 100msec to 5 seconds
e) Background version check is now asynchronous



Note: The following ToDos have not been checked or updated in a while.
If you've suggested something to be done (and have actually read this far)
and it's not listed below, please re-ask for it and I'll try to get it on
the list this time.
